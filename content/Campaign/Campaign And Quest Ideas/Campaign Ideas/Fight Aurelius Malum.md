# Campaign Idea: Fight back against [[Aurelius Malum]]

## Introduction

A series of attacks of creatures from the [[underdark]] have been happening in the region. The creatures are not only attacking the settlements but also kidnapping people. The local authorities are unable to handle the situation, and the players are hired to investigate the matter.

## The Investigation

Going through the region, the players find out that the creatures are being let inside the settlements by some noble houses. The noble houses are working for a powerful entity known as AM. The players need to find out the reason behind the attacks and the connection between the noble houses and AM.

## The Revelation

As time goes by, the players find out that AM is [[Aurelius Malum]], a powerful devil who controls an underground kingdom of devils. He aims to control and destroy the surface-dwelling society by making humanoids, kings, and more bargain their souls to [[the Nine Hells]] with cunning, threats, war, and blackmailing.

## The Final Showdown

The players need to find a way to stop [[Aurelius Malum]] from achieving his goals. They need to find his lair and confront him. [[Aurelius Malum]] is a very powerful devil who hides deep in the underground. He has two powerful skills that one can only have if they are blessed by the [[Over-Deities]] themselves.
