# Akemi's servants
## Overview

## Background
The party members are associated with the Wizardry Institute, either as employees or individuals who owe a significant favor. They work under Akemi, a charismatic and enigmatic woman with golden hair and golden eyes. Akemi is known for her beauty and charm, but as the campaign progresses, her mysterious and unsettling nature becomes more apparent.

## Mission Structure
The missions begin with straightforward tasks but gradually evolve into complex investigations involving cosmic horrors beyond understanding. Here are a few key missions:

1. **[[The Mystery of Elaris Lighthouse (Quest)|The Missing Lighthouse Keepers]]**
   - **Objective**: Discover the fate of a group of lighthouse keepers who have mysteriously disappeared.

2. **[[Sunken Abyssal City (Quest)|Rescue in the Underwater City]]**
   - **Objective**: Rescue a crew of wizards trapped in an underwater city located in the deepest part of the ocean.

## Akemi's Presence
Throughout the missions, the party encounters paintings or statues depicting Akemi in the background, always observing them with a faint smile. As they notice these recurring images, they realize the unsettling truth about her:
- Akemi's eyes glow faintly, and she always appears to be one step ahead, knowing details no one else should.
- She never shows any other expression or emotion beyond a neutral look or faint smile.
- Akemi never blinks, sleeps, eats, drinks, or ages.

### Scary scenes with Akemi
Here are some eerie and unsettling scenes involving Akemi, designed to create a sense of omnipresence and hopelessness:

1. **Unblinking Eyes in Paintings**
   - While exploring, the party finds an old painting. Initially, it seems ordinary, but as they examine it, they notice Akemi faintly painted in the background. Her eyes are unblinking and seem to follow them wherever they move.

2. **Ancient Cave Paintings**
   - The party discovers ancient cave paintings depicting scenes of suffering. Among the figures, they see Akemi, pointing directly at the suffering people or at the characters themselves, her golden eyes eerily clear even in the primitive artwork.

3. **Mirrors Watching Them**
   - When the characters glance at mirrors peripherally, they see Akemi's reflection instead of their own. Her eyes are always fixed on them, giving the impression that she is constantly watching.

4. **Nighttime Visitation**
   - One night, a character wakes up and sees the half-open door of their room. Akemi’s figure stands there, her golden eyes staring directly at them. Before they can react, the door slowly closes on its own.

5. **Mirror Deception**
   - The characters find a mirror that shows Akemi standing behind them when they look into it. When they turn around, no one is there. Looking back at the mirror, they see their own reflection, but with Akemi’s golden eyes.

6. **Animal Followers**
   - Wherever the characters go, they notice that rats and crows seem to follow them. These animals act unusually friendly, almost as if they are under Akemi's influence.

7. **Enemies' Sudden Deaths**
   - Some of the characters’ enemies suddenly drop dead in their presence, their eyes rolling back into their heads. The characters hear Akemi’s faint laughter, whispered on the wind.

8. **Cryptic Messages**
   - The party frequently finds cryptic messages written in Akemi’s distinctive handwriting. These messages appear in random places, such as on walls, in books, or even on their own belongings, always hinting that she knows more than she should.

9. **Distorted Reflections**
   - Occasionally, when the characters look into mirrors, they see Akemi’s reflection instead of their own for a few seconds. This unsettling phenomenon leaves them questioning reality.

10. **Mimicked Eyes and Speech**
    - The characters encounter someone who has the same golden eyes as Akemi and speaks in a similar, composed, and polite manner. This person’s behavior is eerily reminiscent of Akemi, leaving the characters feeling unnerved.

11. **Golden Strands of Hair**
    - Upon waking up, the characters sometimes find golden strands of hair around their room. The hair is unmistakably Akemi’s, suggesting she was there while they slept.
12. **Painful Moaning in Akemi's Place**
   - When resting at Akemi's place or areas under her jurisdiction, the characters hear painful moaning emanating from seemingly empty spaces or specific points in the room. Some believe attacking the source will help, but doing so only makes the moans louder and more agonizing before they finally disappear.

13. **Mangled Attackers**
   - The group learns that Akemi's place was attacked, with many people injured. However, Akemi and a few others emerge unharmed. When questioned, Akemi calmly states she wasn't attacked. The bodies of the attackers are found horribly mangled, with no clear explanation for their fate.

14. **Shadowy Figures**
   - The characters occasionally see shadowy figures that resemble Akemi flitting just out of sight. These figures are never there when they turn to look directly, but their presence is unsettlingly felt.

15. **Whispers in the Wind**
   - When the characters are alone, they hear whispers in Akemi’s voice, offering cryptic advice or warnings. The whispers seem to come from nowhere and are often accompanied by a chilling breeze.

16. **Unnatural Weather**
   - As the characters approach a location associated with Akemi, the weather suddenly changes. A clear day turns into a sudden storm or thick fog, with Akemi’s face briefly visible in the clouds or mist.

17. **Sudden Visions**
   - One or more characters experience sudden, vivid visions of Akemi. These visions show her in various states, such as calmly watching them, performing arcane rituals, or surrounded by suffering souls.

18. **Familiar Stranger**
   - The characters encounter a stranger who behaves exactly like Akemi, with the same mannerisms and voice. This person claims to have never heard of Akemi, leaving the party confused and on edge.

19. **Unseen Forces**
   - Objects around the characters move on their own. Doors slam shut, books fall from shelves, and candles extinguish without explanation. These disturbances often happen when Akemi is mentioned or thought about.

20. **Uncanny Predictions**
   - Akemi makes eerily accurate predictions about the characters' futures. These predictions are always calm and polite but leave the characters feeling unnerved by her apparent knowledge of their personal lives.

21. **Strange Shadows**
    - When the characters cast shadows, they sometimes see Akemi’s silhouette instead of their own. This phenomenon is fleeting, but deeply unsettling.

22. **Unnatural Calm**
    - In times of extreme danger or stress, the characters hear Akemi’s calm voice in their heads, soothing them. This presence is both comforting and disturbing, as it reinforces her omnipresence.

23. **Mirror Doppelgängers**
    - In reflective surfaces, the characters occasionally see themselves as Akemi, mimicking their actions perfectly. This distortion disappears when they look away, leaving them questioning their sanity.

Se fugirem, eu os seguirei; se se apaixonarem e começarem uma família, farei com que eles não vivam muito; e quando vocês estiverem sozinhos, quando estiverem quebrados, quando não forem nada, estarei lá, e os devorarei, saboreando sua carne temperada com tristeza. Então poderei continuar com meus planos.****

## Origin and Nature of Akemi

**Origin:**
Akemi originated from an otherworldly image representing a concept that defies human comprehension, described as "A pain beyond understanding and sins beyond description." This image, whether a carving on stone, a painting on a wall, a drawing on paper, or even a reflection in a mirror, embodies an idea that should not exist. 

One day, a random commoner stumbled upon this image. Upon seeing it, the commoner experienced a strange sensation. Over days, this sensation grew until Akemi awakened, reshaping the commoner's body and mind. Thus, Akemi, a being not born but created by the image, came into existence.

**Nature:**
Akemi is the physical manifestation of the concept depicted by the image. She is not bound by the limitations of a human being and exhibits an unnerving calmness and control. Her golden eyes are a mark of her true nature, and those who see the image are at risk of being converted into her likeness.

## Goals and Motivations
Akemi's goals are deeply rooted in spreading the malevolent image and manipulating human emotions to achieve control over souls and reality itself. Here’s a breakdown of her objectives:

### Main Goal:
**Spread as a Virus**
- Akemi seeks to propagate the otherworldly image like a virus, spreading it through various means such as artifacts, images, and direct influence on individuals. This allows her to extend her influence and presence across the world of [[Aeloria]].

### Secondary Objective:
**Explore Human Emotions**
- Akemi is fascinated by human emotions, particularly guilt, despair, and hatred. She aims to push individuals to their limits, testing the extent to which these emotions can consume and break down a person's psyche. This exploration serves to deepen her understanding of human suffering and vulnerability.

### Final Objective:
**Manifest the Image in Souls**
- Her ultimate goal is to etch the image into the very soul of a person. This process involves breaking down their spirit until all that remains is hopelessness and the image itself. By achieving this, Akemi gains profound control over the soul, enabling her to manipulate and ultimately destroy it.

### Beyond Mortal Realms:
- **Reach the [[Astral Plane]]:** Once she has mastered control over souls, Akemi plans to ascend to the [[astral plane]]. Here, she aims to study the breakdown of souls into despair and use this knowledge to gain access to the gods.
  
- **Control Over Reality:** Ultimately, Akemi seeks to gain control over reality itself. Her ambition is to spread the image to every creature across multiple realities, experimenting with their emotions and existence until she exhausts all possibilities.

### Player Characters' Role:
- **Experimental Subjects:** The player characters are viewed by Akemi as mere tools or lab rats in her grand experiment. She manipulates them, sends them on missions, and observes how they react to different stimuli—all to further her understanding and advance her goals.
