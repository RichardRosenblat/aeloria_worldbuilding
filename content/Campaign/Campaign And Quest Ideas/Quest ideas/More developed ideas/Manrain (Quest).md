### Quest Overview: **Manrain**

**Objective:**  
A powerful Nautiloid, a Mind Flayer ship, hovers ominously above a major city, emitting a terrifying psionic attack that drives weaker-minded people to madness. The players must find a way to stop the psionic assault, save as many citizens as possible, and prevent the Mind Flayers from abducting those with strong minds.

### **Quest Hook:**

The adventurers arrive in a bustling city known for its grand architecture, where towers and spires touch the skies. The city is preparing for a grand festival, and the atmosphere is lively until a dark shadow looms over the city—a Nautiloid ship.

A group of terrified citizens rush towards the players, pleading for help. They speak of people mysteriously jumping from rooftops and towers, drawn by an invisible force. The players can see the Nautiloid ship hovering above, its tentacles extending, and smaller collector ships flying out, rounding up those who resist the call.

### **Key Mechanics:**

**1. Psionic Assault:**
- **Range:** The psionic attack affects anyone who directly looks at the Nautiloid, its collector ships, or even in the general direction of the ship.
- **Saving Throw:** Humanoids with an Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score of 12 or lower must make a saving throw of that specific ability. The DC for the save is 15.
    - **Failure:** The affected individuals feel an overwhelming urge to ascend to the highest point they can reach and throw themselves off.
    - **Success:** The individual resists the call but is left shaken, suffering from a -1 penalty on all saving throws for the next hour.

**2. High-Quality Minds:**
- Mind Flayers value intelligent, wise, and charismatic minds. Anyone with a score of 13 or higher in any of these stats who successfully resists the psionic attack is targeted by the Mind Flayers.
- **Abductions:** Collector ships begin swooping down, attempting to kidnap those who are resistant to the psionic call. The ships are equipped with grappling tentacles and teleportation devices to capture and transport the victims back to the Nautiloid.

### **Encounters:**

**1. The Descent:**
- As the players navigate the city, they witness chaos unfold. People are leaping from buildings, and others scream in terror as they try to look away from the ship.
- The players might encounter groups of citizens trying to resist the pull, including city guards attempting to maintain order. Some might be heroes trying to save others, while others are too weak to resist and must be protected.

**2. Mind Flayer Agents:**
- The Mind Flayers have sent agents to capture specific targets. These agents are advanced Illithids with psionic powers that can challenge even the strongest minds. The players may have to fight these agents to protect high-profile targets in the city.

**3. The Collector Ships:**
- The players can attempt to board one of the collector ships to reach the Nautiloid. The ships are heavily guarded by Gith thralls and mind-controlled minions, making for a dangerous battle.

**4. Confrontation in the Nautiloid:**
- Upon reaching the Nautiloid, the players must navigate the ship’s twisted and alien architecture. They’ll face powerful Mind Flayers, Elder Brains, and a host of psionic traps designed to deter intruders.
- The players must disable the psionic amplifier causing the mass madness. This could involve destroying a central psionic crystal or defeating the Elder Brain controlling the ship.

### **Resolution:**

**Success:**  
- The players successfully disable the psionic attack, causing the Nautiloid to lose power and retreat. They save countless lives and potentially recover valuable artifacts or knowledge from the Mind Flayers. The city's leaders reward them, and the rescued citizens hail them as heroes.

**Failure:**  
- If the players fail to stop the psionic assault in time, the city will suffer immense casualties, and the Nautiloid will retreat with many powerful minds. The players will need to deal with the repercussions of their failure and possibly pursue the Nautiloid to rescue the abducted citizens in a future quest.

### **Additional Elements:**

- **Moral Dilemma:** The players might face situations where they can only save a few citizens or must choose between saving a high-profile target or rescuing several weaker-minded individuals.
- **Clock Mechanic:** Introduce a ticking clock where the longer the players take to stop the psionic assault, the more citizens fall victim to the attack, increasing the difficulty of later encounters.
- **Psionic Corruption:** Prolonged exposure to the Nautiloid’s psionic field could lead to corruption effects on the players, such as temporary madness, nightmares, or even psionic mutations that offer both benefits and drawbacks.

This quest blends high-stakes decision-making, intense combat, and a race against time, perfect for a climactic moment in your campaign.
