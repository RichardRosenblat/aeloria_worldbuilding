- Navigation systems
  1. **Astrolabe of the Deep**: Originally designed for celestial navigation, the astrolabe has been modified to work underwater. By aligning it with specific underwater landmarks or magical ley lines, the adventurers can determine their approximate location and heading.
  2. **Elemental Compass**: Crafted from a combination of enchanted crystals and elemental essences, the elemental compass points towards the nearest source of elemental energy. By attuning the compass to specific elemental forces prevalent in the underwater environment, the adventurers can navigate towards underwater phenomena or magical hotspots.
  3. **Tidal Clock**: A repurposed timekeeping device modified to track the ebb and flow of underwater currents and tides. By observing the rhythmic movements of the tide indicator, the adventurers can estimate their speed and direction relative to the surrounding currents.
  4. **Sea Whisperer's Shell**: A magical shell enchanted to resonate with the whispers of the sea. When held against the hull of the submarine, the shell vibrates in response to underwater currents and disturbances, providing valuable feedback on the surrounding environment.
  5. **Driftwood Divining Rod**: Fashioned from a piece of enchanted driftwood, the divining rod reacts to changes in underwater magnetic fields. By attuning the rod to specific underwater landmarks or magnetic anomalies, the adventurers can navigate with surprising accuracy through the depths.
  6. **Celestial Orrery**: A makeshift orrery crafted from salvaged gears and enchanted crystals, the device maps the movements of celestial bodies and underwater constellations. By aligning the orrery with the stars visible through the surface of the water, the adventurers can determine their position relative to the celestial sphere.
