### Adventure Outline: **"The Endless Day"**

#### **Premise:**
The party is drawn into a time-loop scenario where they must prevent the destruction of a city by an enormous construct. They are guided by mysterious dreams to craft watches that allow them to relive the day each time they fail. To ultimately succeed, they must discover the means to destroy the construct and unravel the nature of the time loop itself.

---

### **Part 1: The Dream and the Task**

- **Introduction:** 
  - The party members all share a vivid, prophetic dream in which a disembodied voice urges them to craft a watch-like device by 23:00 that day. The voice warns them to press the button on the watch when the "world of the people in the city ends." No further information is given—only the urgency of the task.
  - Upon waking, the party finds themselves in a bustling city on the eve of its festival day. The time is 07:00.

- **Objective:** 
  - The party must gather various rare materials from different locations within the city and its surroundings to craft the watches. These materials may include:
    - **Aetherium Crystal:** Found in the heart of the city's sacred temple.
    - **Clockwork Gears:** Obtained from a master tinkerer in the marketplace, but he requires a favor in return.
    - **Timeworn Leather:** Taken from the hide of a rare beast in the nearby forest.
    - **Essence of Time:** Collected from the ancient hourglass in the city’s library, which is guarded by magical wards.

- **Challenges:**
  - The party encounters various obstacles: rival adventurers, city guards, and natural hazards that threaten to delay their progress.
  - They must navigate the social and political landscape of the city, striking deals or making enemies as they gather the materials.

- **Crafting the Watches:**
  - Once all materials are collected, the party must find an ancient workshop hidden beneath the city to assemble the watches. This process takes time, so they must ensure they finish before 23:00.
  - **Time Check:** As the day progresses, remind the players of the approaching deadline.

### **Part 2: The Destruction and the Loop**

- **23:00:**
  - The city’s bells toll, signaling the end of the day. Suddenly, the ground trembles as a colossal construct rises from the depths of the earth. The construct, an ancient and forgotten weapon, begins to wreak havoc, leading to a massive explosion that destroys the entire city.
  - As the explosion occurs, the party members instinctively press the buttons on their watches, and in a flash of light, they find themselves back at the beginning of the day, at 07:00, with their watches and all items intact.

- **Revelation:**
  - The party realizes they are caught in a time loop and must find a way to stop the construct from destroying the city.
  - They now have knowledge of the city's layout, their tasks, and the looming threat, allowing them to plan more efficiently.

---

### **Part 3: Breaking the Loop**

- **Investigation:**
  - The party must investigate the origin of the construct and discover its weakness. Clues point to a **crystal** capable of disrupting the construct's core. This crystal is hidden in the ruins of an ancient civilization, accessible only during specific events in the city’s timeline.
  - They must use the time loop to learn more about the construct, track down the crystal, and devise a plan to hit its core.

- **Challenges:**
  - The party faces new and evolving challenges each loop. The construct’s behavior might change, the city’s inhabitants may start to notice the party’s strange actions, and time itself might become more unstable.
  - They might need to replay certain events to gather more information, perfect their approach, or unlock new areas of the city.

- **Confrontation:**
  - The final battle against the construct requires precise timing and coordination. The party must infiltrate the construct, locate its core, and use the crystal to disrupt it before it can trigger the explosion.

---

### **Part 4: The Infinity Train**

- **Endgame:**
  - After defeating the construct, the fabric of space and time begins to tear, revealing the **Infinity Train**—a massive, cylindrical beam of blue light extending across the horizon.
  - The party can choose to enter the beam. Inside, they are transported to a surreal realm where they can witness all moments of time simultaneously.

- **The Message:**
  - In this realm, the party can send a message back to their past selves, creating the very dream that started their journey. They realize that they are the origin of the time loop and the crafting of the watches.

- **Conclusion:**
  - The party exits the Infinity Train, returning to the now-safe city, their task complete. The loop is broken, the city is saved, and they carry with them the knowledge of their extraordinary journey.

---

### **Key Themes and Elements:**
- **Time Manipulation:** The core of the adventure revolves around time loops, learning from past mistakes, and using foreknowledge to solve problems.
- **Mystery and Discovery:** The players gradually uncover the nature of the time loop, the origin of the construct, and the significance of their actions.
- **Moral and Ethical Choices:** As they loop through the day, the party must decide how to interact with the city's inhabitants, knowing the potential outcomes of their actions.

## Construct behaviour

Here's a breakdown of the initial attack of the construct, focusing on its actions, attacks, and the sequence of events. The idea is to create a sense of escalating danger and chaos as the city is overwhelmed by the construct.

### **Construct Overview:**
- **Name:** The Cataclysm Engine
- **Size:** Gargantuan
- **Appearance:** A towering, mechanical monstrosity with a glowing core at its center. It’s built from ancient, indestructible metal and bristling with weapons, gears, and arcane devices. The construct moves on massive legs that can crush buildings with ease.

### **Phase 1: Emergence (23:00)**

1. **Tremor and Emergence:**
   - **Event:** The ground shakes violently as the bells toll 23:00. Cracks form in the streets, and a deep rumble echoes throughout the city. Suddenly, a massive fissure opens in the city's central square, and the Cataclysm Engine begins to rise.
   - **Effect:** The tremor knocks many NPCs to the ground and causes minor structural damage to buildings. The party feels a sense of impending doom.

2. **Unveiling of the Cataclysm Engine:**
   - **Event:** The construct fully emerges from the fissure, its towering form blotting out the moonlight. Its core, a pulsating crystal of pure energy, glows ominously. The construct scans the city with a mechanical eye, targeting key structures.
   - **Action:** The Cataclysm Engine emits a low, mechanical roar, and its core flares with energy, signaling the start of its attack.

### **Phase 2: Initial Assault (23:05 - 23:15)**

1. **Cataclysmic Beam (23:05):**
   - **Attack:** The construct's core charges up and fires a massive beam of energy at a nearby district. The beam obliterates everything in its path, reducing buildings to rubble and incinerating anything caught in the blast.
   - **Effect:** The beam carves a swath of destruction through the city, creating chaos as citizens flee in panic. The party feels the heat from the beam and witnesses the devastation firsthand.
   - **Target:** A key landmark or district, such as the city’s marketplace or a prominent guildhall, is destroyed.

2. **Shockwave Pulse (23:08):**
   - **Attack:** The construct stomps the ground with a colossal foot, generating a shockwave that radiates outward, toppling buildings and sending debris flying.
   - **Effect:** The shockwave causes massive structural damage to the surrounding area, collapsing buildings and blocking escape routes. The party must make Dexterity saving throws to avoid being hit by flying debris or being knocked prone.
   - **Target:** This attack is focused on densely populated areas, causing maximum casualties and structural damage.

3. **Disintegration Rays (23:10):**
   - **Attack:** The construct’s mechanical arms extend, each arm ending in a cannon that fires concentrated disintegration rays at strategic locations.
   - **Effect:** The rays vaporize their targets instantly. The party might witness key NPCs or allies being disintegrated, adding to the sense of loss and urgency.
   - **Target:** The construct targets important structures such as the city’s watchtower, the main gate, and any defenses that might pose a threat to it.

### **Phase 3: Full-Scale Destruction (23:15 - 23:25)**

1. **Magnetic Field Burst (23:15):**
   - **Attack:** The construct generates a powerful magnetic field that pulls all metal objects within a wide radius towards it, including weapons, armor, and debris.
   - **Effect:** The party and any nearby NPCs wearing metal armor or carrying metal weapons are pulled towards the construct. They must make Strength saving throws to resist being dragged. Objects like swords, shields, and armor pieces are ripped from their owners and pulled into the construct’s core, where they are absorbed for energy.
   - **Target:** This attack affects a large area, potentially disarming or disabling any nearby defenders.

2. **Seismic Hammer Strike (23:18):**
   - **Attack:** The construct lifts one of its massive arms and brings it down with tremendous force, causing a localized earthquake.
   - **Effect:** The impact creates a massive crater and sends shockwaves that topple nearby buildings and throw the party off balance. The ground splits open, creating hazards like fissures and unstable terrain.
   - **Target:** This strike is aimed at the city’s central square, where many civilians and defenders have gathered, causing widespread panic and chaos.

3. **Energy Pulse (23:20):**
   - **Attack:** The construct’s core releases an energy pulse that spreads rapidly across the city, causing all magical and technological devices to malfunction.
   - **Effect:** The pulse disrupts the city's defenses, disables any magical barriers, and causes constructs or golems to go haywire. The party may experience malfunctions in their magical items or equipment.
   - **Target:** The pulse affects the entire city, creating chaos and making any organized defense impossible.

### **Phase 4: The Final Cataclysm (23:25 - 23:30)**

1. **Core Overload (23:25):**
   - **Event:** The Cataclysm Engine’s core begins to pulse faster and brighter as it charges for a final, catastrophic attack.
   - **Effect:** The ground shakes more violently, and cracks begin to spread throughout the city. The air becomes thick with energy, and the party feels an overwhelming sense of doom.
   - **Action:** The party knows they have only moments to react. If they haven't pressed the buttons on their watches by now, they risk being caught in the final explosion.

2. **The Final Explosion (23:30):**
   - **Attack:** The construct’s core reaches critical mass and explodes in a blinding flash of energy, releasing a shockwave that obliterates the entire city and everything within it.
   - **Effect:** The explosion is cataclysmic, leaving nothing but a massive crater where the city once stood. The party, if they have not pressed their watches, will be caught in the blast and presumably killed, only to be sent back to 07:00 to start the day over.
   - **Target:** The entire city and its surroundings are annihilated.

### **Conclusion:**
- **Time Loop Activation:** As the city is destroyed, the party members instinctively press the buttons on their watches, sending them back to the beginning of the day, with all their knowledge intact.
- **Reflection:** The players now realize they must find a way to stop the construct before it can reach this stage again. The clock is ticking, and they have only one day to figure it out.

This sequence of events is designed to create a sense of overwhelming power and inevitability. The party will feel the full weight of the Cataclysm Engine’s destructive capability, driving home the urgency of their mission to stop it.

## Foreshadowing

### **Foreshadowing the Giant Construct**

1. **Ancient Murals:**
   - **Location:** The city’s oldest temple or a forgotten ruin beneath the city.
   - **Description:** The party discovers ancient murals depicting a towering mechanical figure laying waste to a city. The final panel shows a small, glowing crystal being used to bring the construct to its knees. The mural is faded and partially destroyed, but the imagery is clear enough to suggest a catastrophic event in the city’s past.

2. **Prophetic Visions:**
   - **NPC:** An eccentric seer in the marketplace, often dismissed as a lunatic.
   - **Description:** The seer grabs the party members and babbles about a "metal colossus" rising from the earth to "devour the heart of the city." She speaks of a "shard of the earth's core" that alone can quell the beast's rage. Her words are confusing, but the sense of urgency and terror is palpable.

3. **Disrupted Magic:**
   - **Location:** The city’s arcane library or a wizard’s tower.
   - **Description:** The party notices that certain magical artifacts and spells seem to malfunction or behave erratically in certain parts of the city, particularly near the central square. Research in the library reveals that these disturbances coincide with historical records of a “buried titan” whose presence disrupts the flow of magic.

4. **Whispers of the Earth:**
   - **Event:** As the party ventures into the city’s catacombs or beneath the streets, they hear faint, rhythmic tremors beneath the ground, as if something massive is breathing. Occasionally, these tremors grow stronger, accompanied by a low, metallic grinding sound. Old miners or engineers might mention that the earth has been "restless" lately, but dismiss it as a natural phenomenon.

5. **The Hidden Journal:**
   - **Item:** An old, dusty journal found in the library or an abandoned house.
   - **Description:** The journal belongs to a long-dead scholar or engineer who wrote about an ancient project to create a "guardian of the city" that went terribly wrong. The last few entries speak of a "fatal flaw" and mention a "crystal of purest light" that could undo the "titan’s wrath." The entries end abruptly, implying the author met a grim fate.

### **Leads to Investigate the Crystal**

1. **The Alchemist's Legacy:**
   - **Lead:** A reclusive alchemist in the city is known to have studied rare crystals and their properties. The alchemist’s shop is filled with strange concoctions and prototypes. When the party speaks to the alchemist, they discover a set of old notes about an ancient crystal believed to resonate with “primeval energies.” The alchemist believes the crystal can be found deep within the earth, beneath the city.

2. **The Scholar's Tome:**
   - **Lead:** In the city’s arcane library, the party finds references to a long-lost tome titled “The Heart of the Earth.” The book is said to describe a crystal of immense power, capable of disrupting any magical or mechanical construct. The tome’s last known location was in the hands of a scholar who vanished under mysterious circumstances. The party may need to track down the scholar’s descendants or clues leading to his hidden study.

3. **The Underground Resistance:**
   - **Lead:** Rumors circulate about a secretive group of engineers and mages who believe the city’s foundation holds an ancient power source. They are believed to operate out of the old sewer system or abandoned mines. The party could find these individuals, who might have partial knowledge of the crystal or have been researching the construct’s weaknesses.

4. **The Statue of the Fallen Hero:**
   - **Lead:** A statue in the city square commemorates a hero who defended the city during a catastrophic event centuries ago. The inscription on the statue mentions that the hero “held the light that vanquished the darkness.” Investigating the hero’s tomb or relics might reveal more about the crystal, as the hero was likely involved in the last attempt to stop the construct.

5. **The Oracle’s Clue:**
   - **Lead:** The party learns of an oracle living in a remote part of the city or nearby wilderness. The oracle is said to possess knowledge of all things past and future. When consulted, the oracle provides cryptic guidance, mentioning “a star that fell to earth” and “the stone that beats like a heart.” This could lead the party to a location where the crystal is hidden, possibly within a meteorite impact site or deep within a cavern.

6. **The Craftsman’s Secret:**
   - **Lead:** An old craftsman who specializes in clockwork and intricate mechanisms might have knowledge of the construct’s design. The craftsman could reveal that the construct was designed with a weakness—a core that can be disrupted by a specific frequency of energy, which only the crystal can produce. The craftsman may direct the party to a hidden blueprint or a map indicating where the crystal was last seen.

### **Putting It All Together:**
- **Investigation:** The party can follow these leads, each of which might provide a piece of the puzzle. As they gather information, they’ll slowly piece together the location of the crystal and its significance in stopping the construct.
- **Challenges:** Each lead could present its own challenges, such as deciphering ancient texts, navigating dangerous terrain, or dealing with rival factions also seeking the crystal.
- **Revelation:** The final discovery of the crystal should be a significant moment, tying together the foreshadowing elements and leading the party toward their final confrontation with the construct.
