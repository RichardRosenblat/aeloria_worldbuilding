# Quest: Rescue the Trapped Wizards

## Objective
Rescue a crew of wizards trapped in an underwater city located in the deepest part of the ocean.

## How the Wizard's Crew Got Trapped
- One wizard used the correct teleportation circle runes to teleport to the city; the remaining wizards followed after the first one didn't return.
- They discovered that something in the city blocks outgoing teleportation spells, trapping them inside.

## City Description

### General
- The city is built from unusual materials, with buildings that maintain air inside.
- Deserted except for two groups: the explorers (trapped wizards) and the servants (mysterious creatures with porcelain humanoid faces, spider legs, and cloaks hiding their true forms).
- The servants communicate through telepathy, are friendly to the explorers, and obey their commands. They understand common and other languages, but only speak using a disembodied, uniform voice from their porcelain faces.

### Environmental Details
- Artifacts within the buildings keep the air inside but cause sickness when in the same room as humanoid creatures.
- Some buildings have leaks, with water seeping in and flooding the rooms to varying degrees, creating pools of brine.
- Rooms are illuminated by glowing crystals found in the walls and ceilings, the only light source as sunlight doesn't reach the city.
- Rooms often contain furniture, decorations, and other objects in various states of preservation. Some objects are aged or eroded by water, while others seem otherworldly or difficult to understand.

### Food
- Food is scarce; the only source is mutated fish caught in the city's waters, which taste strange but are edible.
- Some rooms have food that appears ready and served but is rotten and inedible.

### Tunnels
- The city is interconnected by numerous underground tunnels spanning multiple levels:
  - **First Level**: Connects all buildings in the city.
  - **Second Level**: Contains rooms with weird artifacts, paintings, or works of art. Some tunnels are flooded, some are vacuums.
  - **Third Level**: The deepest and most dangerous, filled with traps, monsters, and other dangers. The tunnels are filled with water, and air is scarce. Prolonged exposure can cause mutations or worse fates than death.
  - **Fourth Level**: Consists of stairs that are too big, small, or steep for humanoids to traverse.
  - **Fifth Level**: Contains a sealed large door that cannot be opened, either keeping something out or something inside.

### Legends
- Legends speak of a larger artifact at the core of the city, inside a broken, flooded building. This artifact can create an air bubble around the entire city, but it is currently broken.
