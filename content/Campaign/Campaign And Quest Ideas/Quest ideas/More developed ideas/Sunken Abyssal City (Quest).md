   - **Objective**: Rescue a crew of wizards trapped in an underwater city located in the deepest part of the ocean.
   - **City Description**:
     - The city is built from unusual materials, with buildings that maintain air inside, and is deserted except for two groups: the explorers (trapped wizards) and the servants (mysterious creatures with porcelain humanoid faces, spider legs, and cloaks hiding their true forms).
     - Artifacts within the buildings keep the air inside but cause sickness when in the same room.
     - The city is interconnected by numerous underground tunnels, some partially or fully flooded. 
     - Legends speak of a larger artifact capable of creating an air bubble around the entire city, though it is currently broken.
