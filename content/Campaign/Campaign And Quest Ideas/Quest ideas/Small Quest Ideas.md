# Small ideas

Here are some small ideas for quests that can be used in a campaign. They are not meant to be the main focus of the campaign, but rather to add some flavor to the world and to give the players some side quests to do.

They are quite simple and can be (and probably) expanded upon as needed, this is just a place where I plan to write down some ideas for small quests that come to mind.

## Quest of clearing a goblin cave (with [[Makora's Scroll]])

The group must clear out a goblin cave that has been causing trouble for the nearby town. The goblins have been raiding the town and stealing supplies, and the townspeople are desperate for help. The group must enter the cave, defeat the goblins, and retrieve the stolen supplies. At the end of the battle, a desperate goblin reads from a scroll that summons a powerful demon champion. The group must run from the demon to survive.

## Quest with studying a stasis bubble

A magical stasis bubble has appeared or was found in the world. The group must study it to figure out what it is and how it works. The bubble is a small area where time has stopped, and nothing inside can move or change. The group must figure out how to break the bubble and free or study whatever is inside.

## Quest being wrongly arrested 

The group is wrongly arrested for a crime they did not commit. They must escape from prison and clear their names. The group must find evidence to prove their innocence and bring the real criminals to justice. The group must also avoid the guards and other prisoners who are out to get them.

## Quest of elemental convergence

The elemental convergence is happening and threatens to destroy the world. The group must find a way to stop it before it's too late. The group must travel to the [[elemental planes]] and gather the elemental artifacts needed to stop the convergence. The group must also face powerful elemental creatures and other dangers along the way.

## Quest of proctect agains the wild hunt

The group must protect a village from the wild hunt, a event that happens rarely but when it does it's a disaster. The group must find a way to stop the hunt or protect the village from it. The group must also face powerful creatures and other dangers along the way.

## Quest of blood moon

The blood moon is rising and with it comes dark creatures and powerful magic. The group must find a way to stop the blood moon before it's too late. The group must travel to the dark lands and gather the artifacts needed to stop the blood moon. The group must also face powerful creatures and other dangers along the way.

## Quest of heisting a vault

The group must heist a vault that is said to be impossible to break into. The vault is heavily guarded and protected by powerful magic. The group must find a way to break into the vault and steal the treasure inside without getting caught. After getting into the vault, the party may forego stealth and make a run for it, or they may try to sneak out with the treasure.

## Quest of avenging the ghost of a murdered girl

The ghost of a girl who was murdered by a powerful noble seeks the group's help to avenge her death. The group must find the who the noble is and bring him to justice. The noble will do everything in his power to stop the group from finding him, including sending his guards and other minions after them.
