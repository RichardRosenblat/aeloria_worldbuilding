## Random Quotes

1. "Are you aiming for greatness or avoiding disapointment"
2. “the only evil that can be excused as necessary is the one that nation controls”
3. "Si operarii omnes producunt, omnia operariis pertinent."
4. "what do you think it means to be saved"
5. "What happened?" - "Nothing that wasn't my fault"
6. "Something is different"
7. "Well I don't know, but i know one thing. Governments are only excuses to subjugate others to the will of the dominant socio-economic ethnic group, as they control the resources they choose who gets to be punished. So anyways do you want to go to the tavern?"
8. "I don't think so, but i do think that the growing control of those that have the power over the means of production is a threat to the autonomy of the people. As value that is created by the working force is not rewarded to them. Instead only guarantees enough for them to survive and work more. It's like slavery but with extra steps. So anyhow, how's your day going?"
9. "You know, that reminds me that sometimes, violence is the necessary. Sometimes the only path to redemption for the sins of ignorance is to face the fundamental truth of blood and fire. As they meet the primordial within their heartbeat, the oppressors might have a chance to understand the pain they caused and atone for their sins. Also have you seen the new play at the theater?"
10. "You think we're equals? I had to battle struggles you've never imagined. I became this while fearing the night, disguising myself as a man just to travel safely. Our similarities end when you learned to fight your enemies, while I had to fight both enemies and so-called comrades who left me with scars that will never heal. I survived because I was cursed to live as I am among those I swore to protect, only to be seen as their enemy."
11. "The universe is and we are"
12. "We do not have much connection, you and I. Still this encounter feels special, I hope you do not mind if I think of you as a friend" 
13. "This is your home. If you want to fight to defend it, that's your choice. I'd be honoured to stand alongside you. The enemy attacks tomorrow. He's brutal and fights only to kill, which is why he will never defeat us. Look around. In this circle, we're all equals. You're not fighting because someone's ordering you to, you're fighting for so much more than that. You fight for your homes. You fight for your family. You fight for your friends. You fight for the right to grow crops in peace. And if you fall, you fall fighting for the noblest of causes: fighting for your very right to survive! And when you're old and grey, you'll look back on this day, and you'll know you earned the right to live every day in between! So you fight! For your family! For your friends! For Ealdor!"
14. "I can't blame you for wanting to know yourself better, it was one of the biggest pleasures of my life"
15. "The pain of your absence is sharp and haunting, and I would five anything to not know it; anything but never knowing you at all I can only hope that you are safe, wherever you are"
16. "This song is new to me, but I am honored to be part of it"
17. "It's tempting to linger in this moment, but unless they are collapsed by an observer, they will never be more than that, only possibilities"
18. "Are you still here? I am unsure how to survive in a universe without you, I am unsure how to be me without you"
19. "Is the hardest part of this tragedy not knowing who we may have lost? or will the hardest part come later, when we learn?"
20. "Speak, mortal. You have reached Tharvek, Devourer of Innocents and Wielder of Eternal Flames. It appears I have missed your pitiful attempt at contact. Leave your name, teleportation runes, preferred genre of torment, shoe size, allegiance, deepest fears, vulnerabilities, complete medical history, and where you summoned the gall to disturb me. I may choose to acknowledge your existence, but not by such mundane means. Thank you, and remember: tread carefully, for death lurks at every shadowed crossing."
21. "I see someone making through, you just need to be sure it is you"
22. "You are no saint; you're just indifferent. You aid all without caring who they've wronged or what evil they've wrought. You place the wicked among those who shelter you. Even the gods' love is not unconditional, and neither should ours be."
23. As the hag's gaze pierces through the darkness, her voice resonates with an otherworldly chill. "You feel it, don't you? The knot tightening around your throat, the sharp claws of dread digging into your chest, the icy tendrils slithering down your spine? That's the sensation of being forsaken, of standing alone in the void, unnoticed by the gods. Even your soul quivers, knowing that no divine intervention will come to your aid. You're trapped in a blind spot, unseen by the greater powers." Her words hang heavy in the air, suffocating the very essence of hope. "And yet, you cling to your righteous desires, your noble quest to save your friends. But can you be certain that your gods will forgive such a pact with a creature like me? Your actions may be seen as a grievous offense, a betrayal of everything they hold dear. Will they not turn their backs on you? And this dread that gnaws at your spirit, it will not dissipate once you leave this place. It will cling to you like a curse, haunting your every step until the day you finally rest in your grave, a constant reminder of the darkness that lurks within your soul."
24. "In this life, we traverse like a canoe upon deep waters. Our passage ripples the surface briefly, yet the depths remain undisturbed. With time, the surface quiets once more, leaving no trace of our journey."
25. Isabelle-"Such is the reason thine footwear is rugged." Elena-"Such is the reason thine mother is deceased." Isabelle-"..." Elena-"Deceased as [[The Nine Hells]]." Isabelle-"...Gods above." Elena-"Pray tell, what manner of footwear hath she? In her grave?" Isabelle-"..." Elena-"Such is why thine greatmother lacketh knees, and she cannot petition the Lord, wench. How now? She cannot skip as the Elven." Isabelle-"Dismount my carriage!" Elena-"Such is why thy babe, hath a glass eye, and when she weepeth, thou must polish it with lye, wench."  Isabelle-"Dismount at once!" Elena-"I'll exit thine carriage. Flank!"
26. "You are a coward wearing the facade of a revolutionary."
27. "What is better - to be born good, or to overcome your evil nature through great effort?"
28. "I will face god and walk backwards into hell."
29. "The man who sleeps on the floor cannot fall out of bed."
30. "The man who sleeps with a machete is a fool every night but one."
31. "For every person who dreams up a butter knife, there is a person who dreams up a poisoned dagger."
32. "Only the truly dead have seen the end of war."
33. "Does the archer fear his bow? Or does he kiss each arrow goodbye as it marries the wind?"
34. "These feelings can eat away at you, chip away the parts of you that you once held dear and defined you. You remember a time where you felt more complete, had stronger relationships and felt more loved."
35. "To be tall is not a virtue, to be short is not a sin."

37. "You can't kill me in a way that matters."
38. "Do what you must, I have already won."

49. "I would rather die standing than live kneeling."
50. "For even the most banal of deaths can be made tragic by a broken heart."
51. "To love someone is to turn around. To love someone is to look at them."

## Arcane 101 texts
Greetings, esteemed students, and welcome to the inaugural lecture of Arcane 101, a cornerstone in your journey to comprehend the intricate facets of magic in the realm of The Veiled lands.

Magic within our world is as diverse and enigmatic as the multiverse itself. It constitutes an art, a science, and an inexorable force that permeates the very essence of reality. To commence our scholarly endeavor, let us lay a foundation of fundamental understanding.

**The Primary Wellspring of Magic:** Magic, in all its forms, emanates from the Weave. This profound entity, a tapestry of raw energy enveloping our world, serves as the quintessential font of magical power. Practitioners, including wizards and sorcerers, draw upon the Weave to mold and weave their spells.

**The Taxonomy of Magic:** The art of magic is subdivided into eight distinctive schools, each endowed with unique focal points and intrinsic properties. These schools are as follows:

**1. Abjuration:** Primarily devoted to protective and defensive spells, abjurers excel in the crafting of wards, barriers, and shields. Their repertoire extends to the dissolution of magical effects and safeguarding against hostile incantations, thus rendering them invaluable as guardians and counteractives.

**2. Conjuration:** Practitioners of this school specialize in the conjuration of entities and spatial manipulation. They possess the capacity to summon beings, objects, or energies from alternate planes, offering both offensive and utilitarian applications.

**3. Divination:** Diviners are the preeminent authorities on foresight and revelation. Their mastery encompasses glimpses into the future, the scrutiny of thoughts, and the revelation of concealed truths. This school is dedicated to the procurement of knowledge and the illumination of the enigmas inherent in our world.

**4. Enchantment:** Enchanters wield the power to sway the thoughts and emotions of others. Their arsenal encompasses charming, hypnotism, and mental manipulation, making enchantment magic an essential tool for persuasion and control.

**5. Evocation:** Evokers harness the potent and destructive forces of elemental magic, encompassing fire, water, earth, air, and the spectra in between. Proficient in spells that unleash these primal energies for direct damage or formidable energy-based effects, they are the purveyors of fireballs, lightning bolts, blizzards, and potent forceful discharges.

**6. Illusion:** Illusionists craft illusions and sensory distortions, capable of making the unreal appear real, summoning phantasmal entities, and warping perceptions. Illusion magic is the very embodiment of trickery and deception.

**7. Necromancy:** The purview of necromancers delves into the realms of life and death. Their dominion encompasses the reanimation of the deceased, the siphoning of life energy, and the manipulation of souls, often associated with the realm of the undead and negative energies.

**8. Transmutation:** Transmuters are the alchemists and shape-shifters of the arcane world. Their adeptness lies in the alteration of object properties, transmutation of substances, and even self-metamorphosis. Transmutation magic is celebrated for its versatility and is frequently employed for augmentation and utility.

Each school of magic possesses a distinctive focus and inherent properties, with wizards often electing to specialize in one particular school, while maintaining the capacity to acquire spells from other schools. Familiarity with these diverse schools is integral to your progression in studies and your odyssey into the world of mystic adventures.

In closing, bear in mind that the path of a wizard is one of perpetual scholarship and exploration. It is a lifelong pursuit, one that beckons you to embrace the marvels and enigmas of the arcane. Through unwavering dedication and relentless practice, you shall unravel the secrets of the multiverse and attain mastery over its mystic forces.

**Components and Spellcasting:** Casting a spell typically necessitates the utilization of Verbal, Somatic, and Material components. These incantations, gestures, and, at times, specific ingredients constitute the wellspring of your spellcasting. The complexity of these components varies in direct proportion to a spell's potency.

**Spell Hierarchy:** Spells are categorized into diverse levels, ranging from cantrips, the rudimentary and minor incantations, to high-level spells of monumental influence. As the spell level ascends, so does its potency, commensurate with the requisite skill and energy for casting.

**Casting Time and Duration:** Spells exhibit a spectrum of casting durations, spanning from fractions of a second to multiple minutes. The temporal scope of their effects can be instantaneous, persist for a finite duration, or even endure permanently in certain instances.

**Spell Slots:** Spellcasters are endowed with a finite allotment of spell slots, representing their reservoir of magical energy for a given day. The casting of a spell consumes a spell slot, necessitating judicious management during your escapades.

**Components of a Spell:** Most spells entail a verbal component, entailing the recitation of an incantation; a somatic component, necessitating precise gestures; and occasionally, a material component, involving the use of specific items to facilitate casting.

**Concentration:** A subset of spells mandates the sustenance of concentration for the perpetuation of their effects. Consequently, one cannot simultaneously cast another concentration-requiring spell or undertake activities that necessitate concentration.

In the weeks to come, we shall delve into the intricacies of each magical school, delve into the study of mystical creatures, and explore the art of crafting magical artifacts and elixirs. As a reminder, the path of a wizard is an enduring odyssey, with many domains of magic shrouded in mystery and untapped wonder. It is an existence-long pursuit, and I expect you to embrace the marvels and riddles of the arcane. With unwavering diligence and unwavering practice, you will unlock the secrets of the multiverse and wield its magic with consummate skill.

In our next class, we shall expand upon the concept of planes and their role in the intricate lattice of material and psychic existence. In preparation for this, I will ask each of you to craft a 500-word research on the following topics: Metaphysical, Metapsychic, Echoes, and Liminal. Pertinent literature on these subjects can be located in the school's library; therefore, kindly make contact with the current librarian on duty to secure copies of the requisite texts. For students of this course, access to these materials is afforded without charge for a [[Days of The Week|week]], within the confines of our campus. However, do exercise due diligence in returning the books promptly to evade the imposition of fees.

## Text about [[False Hydra]]

As the [[Solis|sun]] reaches its zenith, bathing the renowned town of Eldor in a warm midday glow, you approach its gates with the hum of prosperity in the air. Eldor, a hub of commerce and bustling activity, is known far and wide for its ever-expanding trade routes and vibrant marketplaces.

However, as your party enters through the sturdy gates, the lively sounds of the town seem to be a mere echo of the tales told by passing travelers. The streets, though not completely empty, lack the usual throngs of people that were vividly painted in stories shared on the road. Perhaps, you consider, those tales were colored with the exaggerations of eager storytellers.

As you traverse the cobbled streets, shadows dance around you—odd, elusive shapes that defy the logic of the midday [[Solis|sun]]. These shadows seem to writhe and elongate, flitting between buildings and alleys, yet their origins remain elusive. At first, you attempt to discern the objects casting these mysterious shadows, but your gaze falters, and soon the shadows become an unremarkable part of the surroundings.

The heart of the town, its bustling market square, draws you closer with the promise of answers. But as you approach, the harmonious sounds of commerce are replaced by a discordant symphony of panic. What was once a market alive with activity is now a scene of chaos and fear.

Citizens flee in all directions, their joyous expressions replaced with terror. The air is thick with tension, and the once vibrant marketplace becomes a surreal battleground. You hear distressed cries, and your senses are overwhelmed by a haunting melody that seems to emanate from the very air itself—a song of both beauty and dread.

Investigating further, you realize that the source of the commotion is a tragic tableau unfolding in the center of the plaza. A citizen, defenseless and paralyzed by fear, is under attack. Wounds mar their body, inflicted by an unseen force. You glimpse fleeting images at the edges of your vision—distorted figures that could be the cause of the mayhem.

The haunting song crescendos, drowning out the terrified screams, and you find yourself in front of a shapeless horror. The air shivers with an otherworldly resonance, and as you attempt to comprehend the scene, your vision blurs, and the world fades away.

Suddenly, you awaken in unfamiliar surroundings—a dimly lit room with the scent of aged wood and stale ale. Three days have passed, and the details of the harrowing encounter in Eldor's market escape your memory like elusive shadows in the daylight. The town holds its secrets, and the eerie song lingers in your subconscious, leaving you with a haunting sense of unease.


## Random scene i thought of

### Meeting the [[Raven Queen, Goddess of Death, Crows and Winter - The Matron of Death (LN)|Raven Queen]]
As you awaken, you find yourself lying on soft grass. You can't recall how you arrived here, only that the battle against the Archlich Zalphar looms faintly in your memory. The sound of the wind, the grass tickling your skin, and the scent of flowers envelop your senses, providing a serene contrast to the chaos you remember. Opening your eyes, they take a moment to adjust, showing a colorful sky above, painted in shades of orange, pink, and purple by the setting sun. Sitting up, you take in the beautiful meadow around you, with tall grass and vibrant flowers swaying gently in the breeze. A calm lake reflects the sky, surrounded by rolling hills and trees.

Looking down, you notice your garments, your usual comfortable clothes—a simple shirt and pants. In your hand there is the warmth of a small silver locket. Opening it, you see a delicate painting of you and your lost fiance laughing together, a memory of happier times. It's warmth feels like Amanda's hand holding yours, something you've missed dearly since her passing, the feeling comforting you in this unfamiliar place.

Distracted by the locket, you almost don't notice the presence next to you. A beautiful woman stands silently, her hands behind her back, looking out at the horizon. Her short black hair and almost pale skin contrast with her dark clothes, adorned with raven tattoos on her arms. Her black irises and pearl piercings, along with a black choker featuring a raven skull, make her appearance both striking and enigmatic.

As you finally notice her, she crouches to meet your eyes. "I'm sorry to disturb your thoughts," she says gently. "That's a beautiful locket."

You clutch the locket a bit tighter. "It belonged to my lover, Amanda...she is no longer with us." you say, your voice tinged with emotion before facing the figure. "I'm sorry, who are you?"

She smiles softly. "I know who you are, Rayos. Do you remember me?"

A sudden realization washes over you. Memories from your a few second after your birth flood back, you in the arms of your mother, and you recall this figure behind her, watching over you wearing a porcelain mask, the goddess of death that visits all mortals only twice, once at birth and once at death. "You...you're the [[Raven Queen, Goddess of Death, Crows and Winter - The Matron of Death (LN)|Raven Queen]]," you whisper, understanding dawning on you. Then, the final moments of the battle come rushing back—the disintegrate spell, you stepping in front of your friends to protect them, the searing pain, and then...nothing. "I died, didn't I?"

She nods, her expression one of deep empathy. "Yes, you did. You died protecting your friends. It was a brave and noble act. You have earned your rest and now it is time to move on."

A mix of relief and sadness fills you. "The battle... did we win?" you ask, your voice barely above a whisper

Her head tilts slightly. "Your friends are fighting on. They are strong and resourceful. They will remember you and honor your sacrifice."

Remembering your friends, you feel a pang of guilt for leaving them behind. "Can I go back? To help them finish it?" you ask, a glimmer of hope in your eyes.

The [[Raven Queen, Goddess of Death, Crows and Winter - The Matron of Death (LN)|Raven Queen]]'s eyes, filled with a timeless sadness, meet yours. "I'm afraid your time in the living world has ended. This is the only thing I cannot change. Is there anything else you wish to ask or do?"

A thought springs to your mind. "Will I meet my lover in the afterlife?" you ask, your voice wavering with hope.

A soft smile graces her lips. "Yes, you will. She is waiting for you. She has been waiting for you since the day you parted."

You feel a wave of immense relief wash over you. Clutching the locket tightly, you close your eyes and ask "May I ask one more thing? May you take care of my friends, help them find another sorcerer to help them destroy the eye of Vecna?"

The [[Raven Queen, Goddess of Death, Crows and Winter - The Matron of Death (LN)|Raven Queen]] eyebrows raise slightly and her smile turns into a small chuckle as if you asked her the most obvious thing. "Of course, Rayos. I will watch over them and guide them in their journey. You have my word."

You nod, feeling a sense of peace and closure. "Thank you. I am ready to see Amanda again."

The [[Raven Queen, Goddess of Death, Crows and Winter - The Matron of Death (LN)|Raven Queen]] extends her hand, helping you to your feet. The meadow around you seems to glow with a soft light as you prepare to move on. "Follow me," she says, her voice comforting and familiar, like that of a long-lost friend.

With one last look at the serene meadow, you see your friends in the distance, fighting valiantly against the Archlich Zalphar. You smile, knowing they will be okay. Turning back to the [[Raven Queen, Goddess of Death, Crows and Winter - The Matron of Death (LN)|Raven Queen]], she now has her porcelain mask on, her eyes hidden behind it. You take her hand and step forward, following [[Raven Queen, Goddess of Death, Crows and Winter - The Matron of Death (LN)|the Matron of Death]] into the next phase of your existence, knowing that peace and reunion await you.
