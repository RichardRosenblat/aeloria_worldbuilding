## Arcane 101 texts
Greetings, esteemed students, and welcome to the inaugural lecture of Arcane 101, a cornerstone in your journey to comprehend the intricate facets of magic in the realm of The Veiled lands.

Magic within our world is as diverse and enigmatic as the multiverse itself. It constitutes an art, a science, and an inexorable force that permeates the very essence of reality. To commence our scholarly endeavor, let us lay a foundation of fundamental understanding.

**The Primary Wellspring of Magic:** Magic, in all its forms, emanates from the Weave. This profound entity, a tapestry of raw energy enveloping our world, serves as the quintessential font of magical power. Practitioners, including wizards and sorcerers, draw upon the Weave to mold and weave their spells.

**The Taxonomy of Magic:** The art of magic is subdivided into eight distinctive schools, each endowed with unique focal points and intrinsic properties. These schools are as follows:

**1. Abjuration:** Primarily devoted to protective and defensive spells, abjurers excel in the crafting of wards, barriers, and shields. Their repertoire extends to the dissolution of magical effects and safeguarding against hostile incantations, thus rendering them invaluable as guardians and counteractives.

**2. Conjuration:** Practitioners of this school specialize in the conjuration of entities and spatial manipulation. They possess the capacity to summon beings, objects, or energies from alternate planes, offering both offensive and utilitarian applications.

**3. Divination:** Diviners are the preeminent authorities on foresight and revelation. Their mastery encompasses glimpses into the future, the scrutiny of thoughts, and the revelation of concealed truths. This school is dedicated to the procurement of knowledge and the illumination of the enigmas inherent in our world.

**4. Enchantment:** Enchanters wield the power to sway the thoughts and emotions of others. Their arsenal encompasses charming, hypnotism, and mental manipulation, making enchantment magic an essential tool for persuasion and control.

**5. Evocation:** Evokers harness the potent and destructive forces of elemental magic, encompassing fire, water, earth, air, and the spectra in between. Proficient in spells that unleash these primal energies for direct damage or formidable energy-based effects, they are the purveyors of fireballs, lightning bolts, blizzards, and potent forceful discharges.

**6. Illusion:** Illusionists craft illusions and sensory distortions, capable of making the unreal appear real, summoning phantasmal entities, and warping perceptions. Illusion magic is the very embodiment of trickery and deception.

**7. Necromancy:** The purview of necromancers delves into the realms of life and death. Their dominion encompasses the reanimation of the deceased, the siphoning of life energy, and the manipulation of souls, often associated with the realm of the undead and negative energies.

**8. Transmutation:** Transmuters are the alchemists and shape-shifters of the arcane world. Their adeptness lies in the alteration of object properties, transmutation of substances, and even self-metamorphosis. Transmutation magic is celebrated for its versatility and is frequently employed for augmentation and utility.

Each school of magic possesses a distinctive focus and inherent properties, with wizards often electing to specialize in one particular school, while maintaining the capacity to acquire spells from other schools. Familiarity with these diverse schools is integral to your progression in studies and your odyssey into the world of mystic adventures.

In closing, bear in mind that the path of a wizard is one of perpetual scholarship and exploration. It is a lifelong pursuit, one that beckons you to embrace the marvels and enigmas of the arcane. Through unwavering dedication and relentless practice, you shall unravel the secrets of the multiverse and attain mastery over its mystic forces.

**Components and Spellcasting:** Casting a spell typically necessitates the utilization of Verbal, Somatic, and Material components. These incantations, gestures, and, at times, specific ingredients constitute the wellspring of your spellcasting. The complexity of these components varies in direct proportion to a spell's potency.

**Spell Hierarchy:** Spells are categorized into diverse levels, ranging from cantrips, the rudimentary and minor incantations, to high-level spells of monumental influence. As the spell level ascends, so does its potency, commensurate with the requisite skill and energy for casting.

**Casting Time and Duration:** Spells exhibit a spectrum of casting durations, spanning from fractions of a second to multiple minutes. The temporal scope of their effects can be instantaneous, persist for a finite duration, or even endure permanently in certain instances.

**Spell Slots:** Spellcasters are endowed with a finite allotment of spell slots, representing their reservoir of magical energy for a given day. The casting of a spell consumes a spell slot, necessitating judicious management during your escapades.

**Components of a Spell:** Most spells entail a verbal component, entailing the recitation of an incantation; a somatic component, necessitating precise gestures; and occasionally, a material component, involving the use of specific items to facilitate casting.

**Concentration:** A subset of spells mandates the sustenance of concentration for the perpetuation of their effects. Consequently, one cannot simultaneously cast another concentration-requiring spell or undertake activities that necessitate concentration.

In the weeks to come, we shall delve into the intricacies of each magical school, delve into the study of mystical creatures, and explore the art of crafting magical artifacts and elixirs. As a reminder, the path of a wizard is an enduring odyssey, with many domains of magic shrouded in mystery and untapped wonder. It is an existence-long pursuit, and I expect you to embrace the marvels and riddles of the arcane. With unwavering diligence and unwavering practice, you will unlock the secrets of the multiverse and wield its magic with consummate skill.

In our next class, we shall expand upon the concept of planes and their role in the intricate lattice of material and psychic existence. In preparation for this, I will ask each of you to craft a 500-word research on the following topics: Metaphysical, Metapsychic, Echoes, and Liminal. Pertinent literature on these subjects can be located in the school's library; therefore, kindly make contact with the current librarian on duty to secure copies of the requisite texts. For students of this course, access to these materials is afforded without charge for a [[Days of The Week|week]], within the confines of our campus. However, do exercise due diligence in returning the books promptly to evade the imposition of fees.

# Text about [[False Hydra]]

As the [[Solis|sun]] reaches its zenith, bathing the renowned town of Eldor in a warm midday glow, you approach its gates with the hum of prosperity in the air. Eldor, a hub of commerce and bustling activity, is known far and wide for its ever-expanding trade routes and vibrant marketplaces.

However, as your party enters through the sturdy gates, the lively sounds of the town seem to be a mere echo of the tales told by passing travelers. The streets, though not completely empty, lack the usual throngs of people that were vividly painted in stories shared on the road. Perhaps, you consider, those tales were colored with the exaggerations of eager storytellers.

As you traverse the cobbled streets, shadows dance around you—odd, elusive shapes that defy the logic of the midday [[Solis|sun]]. These shadows seem to writhe and elongate, flitting between buildings and alleys, yet their origins remain elusive. At first, you attempt to discern the objects casting these mysterious shadows, but your gaze falters, and soon the shadows become an unremarkable part of the surroundings.

The heart of the town, its bustling market square, draws you closer with the promise of answers. But as you approach, the harmonious sounds of commerce are replaced by a discordant symphony of panic. What was once a market alive with activity is now a scene of chaos and fear.

Citizens flee in all directions, their joyous expressions replaced with terror. The air is thick with tension, and the once vibrant marketplace becomes a surreal battleground. You hear distressed cries, and your senses are overwhelmed by a haunting melody that seems to emanate from the very air itself—a song of both beauty and dread.

Investigating further, you realize that the source of the commotion is a tragic tableau unfolding in the center of the plaza. A citizen, defenseless and paralyzed by fear, is under attack. Wounds mar their body, inflicted by an unseen force. You glimpse fleeting images at the edges of your vision—distorted figures that could be the cause of the mayhem.

The haunting song crescendos, drowning out the terrified screams, and you find yourself in front of a shapeless horror. The air shivers with an otherworldly resonance, and as you attempt to comprehend the scene, your vision blurs, and the world fades away.

Suddenly, you awaken in unfamiliar surroundings—a dimly lit room with the scent of aged wood and stale ale. Three days have passed, and the details of the harrowing encounter in Eldor's market escape your memory like elusive shadows in the daylight. The town holds its secrets, and the eerie song lingers in your subconscious, leaving you with a haunting sense of unease.
