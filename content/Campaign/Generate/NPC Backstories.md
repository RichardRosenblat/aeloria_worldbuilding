# NPC Backstories

When you need a quick NPC backstory, roll on this table to generate one. The table is divided into three sections: the NPC's background, their current situation, and their goals.

## Backstory Phrases


if you need to create more of these use the following prompt:

```
i want to make a roll table with a list of first person phrases that describe the backstories of random npcs to add depth to their characters whenever i need to come up with it on the spot


write the column with the number of the phrase, the phrase itself, their current situation, and their goals.

now make 10 more but put (job) in the place where a job would go in the phrases
```
