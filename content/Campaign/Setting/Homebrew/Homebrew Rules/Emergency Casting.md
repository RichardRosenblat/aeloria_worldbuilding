# Emergency Spell Casting: A Homebrew Rule

In Aeloria, practitioners of the arcane arts often find themselves in precarious situations where traditional spellcasting methods falter. To address such dire circumstances, a novel approach known as "Emergency Spell Casting" has emerged among the learned circles of spellcasters.

## Mechanics:

### Utilizing the Spellbook as a Source of Magic

The core premise of Emergency Spell Casting revolves around the utilization of a wizard's spellbook as a reservoir of magical potential. In dire situations where the party's survival hangs by a thread, a wizard may opt to tear a page from their spellbook and invoke its magic akin to the activation of a spell scroll. 

### Preparation and Sacrifice

However, to enable this impromptu spellcasting, the wizard must have previously performed a ritual that takes 10 minutes per spell level, incorporating any material components required by the spell as well as consuming any materials that would be consumed by the spell's regular casting. 

This ritual imbues the ink and paper of the specific pages of the spellbook with the necessary magical energies to function as a spell scroll. Once prepared, the page can be torn and used as a scroll for Emergency Spell Casting by any creature that can use a spell scroll of that spell. However, this act comes at a significant cost: the irretrievable destruction of the torn page and its corresponding spell from the wizard's repertoire.

### Ultimate Attack: Unleashing Havoc

In dire emergencies, a wizard who has authored the spellbook's pages, and only they, can unleash a devastating ultimate attack. By triggering all the spells prepared for Emergency Spell Casting at once, the wizard unleashes a havoc of magical prowess. This ultimate attack annihilates all the spells prepared for Emergency Spell Casting, triggering multiple effects in a chaotic surge of power.

For this effect to occur, the wizard must be the one to copy and prepare the spells for Emergency Spell Casting. If they have only copied or prepared some of the spells, the remaining ones will remain uncast. Additionally, any pages not authored by the wizard casting these effects will not be used in this ultimate attack.

### Implementation and Considerations

To implement Emergency Spell Casting, Dungeon Masters are encouraged to interpret the wizard's spellbook as akin to a collection of spell scrolls, albeit in a more dynamic form. Wizards may choose to sacrifice a spell from their spellbook in exchange for a momentary surge of magical prowess, thereby aiding their allies in the face of overwhelming odds.

While Emergency Spell Casting offers a potent lifeline in moments of desperation, its implementation necessitates careful consideration of balance and gameplay dynamics. Dungeon Masters should be mindful of the scarcity of spells within a wizard's spellbook, the inherent risks associated with sacrificing spells, and the potential consequences of overreliance on Emergency Spell Casting in encounters.
