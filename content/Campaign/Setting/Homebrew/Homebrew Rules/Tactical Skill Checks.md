# Homebrew Rule: Tactical Skill Checks

"Fall you fish-faced foul fiend from fetid fathoms of festering filth!" - Tybur, the alliterative bard, before pulling a rope tied to the night hag's ankle

In addition to their regular actions during combat, characters can now perform tactical skill checks. These checks can be made before or after their action on their turn, provided they have not used their action to perform another task that requires full focus or concentration. Tactical skill checks allow characters to use their skills in creative ways to gain an advantage in combat or to gather information about their surroundings. The Dungeon Master determines the difficulty of the check and the potential consequences of success or failure.

## Mechanics

1. **Initiating a Skill Check:** Before or after taking their regular action, a character can declare their intent to make a tactical skill check. They must specify the skill they wish to use and the target of the check (if applicable).

2. **Skill Check Resolution:** The Dungeon Master determines the difficulty of the skill check based on the circumstances and the target's characteristics. They set a DC (Difficulty Class) for the check. The player rolls a d20 and adds their relevant skill modifier to the result. The DM then compares the total to the DC to determine success or failure.

4. **Consequences:** Success can provide various benefits, such as gaining insight into an enemy's tactics, finding a hidden object, or intimidating an opponent. Failure may result in no effect or potentially alerting enemies to the character's intentions.

**Examples of Tactical Skill Checks:**

1. **Intimidation:** A character can attempt to intimidate an enemy to gain advantage in combat or to persuade them to flee or stand down.

2. **Perception:** A character can make a perception check to search for hidden objects or traps in their immediate surroundings.

3. **Insight:** A character can try to predict an enemy spellcaster's next move by making an insight check against the enemy's spellcasting ability.

4. **Pickpocketing:** A character can attempt to pickpocket an enemy during combat to steal an item or weapon.

5. **Search:** A character can search the surrounding area for cover, escape routes, or other tactical advantages.

**Notes:**

- Not all actions will lend themselves to tactical skill checks. The DM has the final say on whether a skill check is appropriate in a given situation.
- The DM has discretion over the consequences of success or failure and may adjust the outcomes based on the specific circumstances of the encounter.
- This homebrew rule was created to encourage players to think creatively and strategically during combat encounters and to make use of their characters' skills in new and interesting ways.
