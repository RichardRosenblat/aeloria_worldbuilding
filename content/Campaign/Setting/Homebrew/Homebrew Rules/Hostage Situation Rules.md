# Hostage Situations

When an character is holding another character, enemy or NPC hostage, the following rules apply:

1. **Taking Hostages**: Characters can attempt to take hostages during combat or other situations. This typically involves grappling the target and making a successful check to restrain them. If successful the hostage taker can define a readied action to execute as described below in the "Hostage Taker's Actions" section.

2. **Attacking the Hostage Taker**: Characters can attempt to attack the enemy holding the hostage. However, if the attack roll misses by 3 or more, the attack instead hits the hostage. This rule emphasizes the risk involved in such a precarious situation.
   - **Example**: If the enemy's Armor Class (AC) is 15 and the attacker rolls a total of 12 or lower, the attack hits the hostage.

3. **Hostage Taker's Actions**:
   - **Holding the Hostage**: Besides the rules described here, the rules for grappling and restraining a creature apply to the hostage taker (the grappler) and the hostage (the grappled creature). 
   - **Readying an Action**: The hostage taker can prepare an action while holding the hostage, following the standard rules for readying an action. This typically involves the enemy stating a trigger and a specific action they will take if the trigger occurs. Any action taken by the hostage taker in regard to the hostage are made with advantage.
     - **Example**: "If anyone moves closer, I will cut the hostage's throat." If the stated trigger happens, the readied action is executed immediately after the trigger as a reaction.

4. **Hostage Resistance**:
   - **Escape Attempts**: The hostage can attempt to escape using the rules for escaping a grapple (contested by the enemy's Athletics or Acrobatics check).
   - **Aid Actions**: Allies can use the Help action to give the hostage advantage on their escape attempts or to distract the hostage taker, potentially providing a strategic advantage.

5. **Cover and Positioning**:
   - **Three-Quarters Cover**: By default, the hostage taker and hostage provide each other with three-quarters cover (+5 to AC and Dexterity saving throws).
   - **Half Cover**: If the hostage is significantly smaller than the hostage taker (e.g., a sprite being held by a tallman), the cover provided may be reduced to half cover (+2 to AC and Dexterity saving throws). The DM has discretion to determine when this applies based on the size difference and positioning.

6. **DM Discretion**: The Dungeon Master (DM) has the final say on how these rules are applied in different scenarios, considering the specific context and creativity of the players' actions.
