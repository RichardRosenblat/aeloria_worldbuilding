# Mythic Inspiration

"Asking a random deep question to the most unsuspecting person in the room can lead to the most interesting conversations, or the most awkward silences." - Embra, explaining why she asked the kid about the socio-political implications of the local festival

In your adventures throughout the world of [[Aeloria]], you may uncover secrets, delve into ancient ruins, or seek knowledge of the realm's rich history. As you interact with the world and delve deeper into its mysteries, you may be rewarded with Mythic Inspiration.

## Acquiring Mythic Inspiration: 

Mythic Inspiration is earned through actions that specifically engage with the lore, history, and unique elements of [[Aeloria]]. This can include:

- Asking insightful questions about the lore of a location or the history of a particular event to a knowledgeable NPC.
- Demonstrating familiarity with the people, cultures, or languages of [[Aeloria]].
- Exploring ancient ruins, deciphering arcane symbols, or unraveling the mysteries of forgotten civilizations.
- Engaging in rituals or ceremonies that are tied to the world's elemental forces or cosmic entities.
- Resolving conflicts or challenges in a way that reflects the values, beliefs, or traditions of a particular culture or faction your character is connected to.

When you engage with the world in these ways, the DM may award you with Mythic Inspiration. This special type of inspiration can be used to achieve extraordinary feats and overcome the greatest challenges.

## Using Mythic Inspiration:

When you are inspired by the profound mysteries of [[Aeloria]], you can expend your Mythic Inspiration to achieve extraordinary feats. You can use your Mythic Inspiration to gain the following benefits:

- **Triple Advantage:** When making an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, you can expend your Mythic Inspiration to gain triple advantage. This means you roll three d20s and choose the highest result, giving you an unparalleled chance of success.

**Note:** Mythic Inspiration is a special type of inspiration and does not stack with regular inspiration. Once you expend your Mythic Inspiration, it is lost until you earn it again through your interactions with the world of [[Aeloria]].

Harness the ancient wisdom and cosmic energies of [[Aeloria]] to overcome the greatest challenges and unlock the secrets of this extraordinary realm!
