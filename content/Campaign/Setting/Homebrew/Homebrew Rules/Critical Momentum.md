# Variant Rule: Critical Momentum

"Fortune favors the bold, but misfortune favors the stupid." - Old saying

In the ever-shifting tapestry of fate, the balance of fortune and misfortune is a delicate dance. In this variant rule, the natural extremes—rolling a natural 1 or a natural 20—echoes through the fabric of reality, potentially amplifying their effects to legendary or catastrophic proportions.

When a player rolls a natural 1 or a natural 20 on a d20 roll, the tale takes an unexpected turn. They can pick to roll another d20. If the result matches the initial roll, the critical momentum builds, enhancing the outcome further. The player continues to roll additional d20s. However, if they roll a different number or accumulate three identical rolls, the surge of fortune or misfortune reaches its zenith and they do not roll any more d20s.

**Critical Failure:**
- Rolling a natural 1 initiates a critical failure. The consequences could range from minor setbacks to disastrous outcomes, depending on the circumstances. For instance, the adventurer might suffer immediate harm, such as being wounded or temporarily blinded for a turn. Alternatively, they could accidentally drop their weapon, leaving them momentarily defenseless.
- Should a player roll two natural 1s consecutively, the repercussions intensify. Perhaps they suffer double damage, break their weapon, or incur a lingering curse for the rest of the day.
- Should the unfortunate streak persist with three natural 1s in a row, the ramifications become dire. They might lose a limb, invoke the wrath of a powerful entity, or suffer a permanent curse.

**Critical Success:**
- Rolling a natural 20 heralds a critical success, duplicating damage dice and bringing forth favorable outcomes or extraordinary feats.
- If a player achieves two natural 20s in succession, the effects escalate. They might unveil hidden boons, grant debilitating debuffs to foes, or uncover new items.
- Should the streak culminate in three natural 20s in a row, the rewards become legendary. They could instantly kill an enemy, receive powerful magic items, earn the favor of divine entities, or create sudden burst of potent spells or legendary effects.
