# D&D 5E Mechanics for Fights on a Train

"What do you mean stop the train? Do i look like a conductor to you?! Fine, fine, I'll see what I can do. If we survive this, I swear in the name of [[Bahamut, God  of Justice and Nobility - The Platinum Dragon (LG)|the Fair One]], I am never taking a train with any of you again!" - Paelias, Half-Orc Paladin

## 1. Environmental Features

**Train Cars:** Each car has distinct features and dimensions. Common types include passenger cars, cargo cars, dining cars, and specialized cars (like a magical laboratory or an armory).

**Movement and Balance:** Characters must maintain their balance while the train is in motion.

- **Dexterity Saving Throws:** At the start of each character’s turn, they must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone and be pushed 5 feet back in the direction opposite to the train's movement.
- **Moving Between Cars:** Characters need to make a DC 12 Acrobatics or Athletics check to move between cars. Failing this check means the character ends their movement at the doorway and cannot move further that turn.

**Wind and Noise:** The wind and noise can make communication and ranged attacks difficult.

- **Perception Checks:** Disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks relying on hearing.
- **Ranged Attacks:** Ranged weapon attacks have disadvantage unless the character is inside a car.

**Magical Fields:** Magical fields could affect spellcasting or create areas of wild magic.

- **Spellcasting:** In some areas, spellcasters must succeed on a DC 12 Arcana check to cast spells. Failing this check results in the spell fizzling out.

## 2. Hazards and Obstacles

**Low Bridges and Tunnels:** Characters on the roof must be wary of low-hanging obstacles.

- **Dexterity Saving Throws:** Characters must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw to duck or jump over obstacles. Failing this check results in 3d6 bludgeoning damage, being knocked prone, and being pushed 10 feet back in the direction opposite to the train's movement.

**Sudden Stops or Turns:** The train’s sudden movements can throw characters off balance.

- **Strength Saving Throws:** When the train stops or turns suddenly, characters must make a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be thrown 10 feet in a random direction, taking 2d6 bludgeoning damage if they collide with a hard surface.

**Loose Cargo:** Unsecured cargo can become a hazard during combat.

- **Improvised Weapons:** Loose cargo can be used as improvised weapons (1d4 damage).
- **Dexterity Saving Throws:** Characters in a cargo car must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw each round or take 1d6 bludgeoning damage from shifting cargo.

## 3. Dynamic Elements

**Speed Control:** Characters might need to speed up, slow down, or stop the train.

- **Engine Room:** Controlling the train requires access to the engine room. Operating the controls requires an Intelligence (Arcana) check (DC 14).

**Car Separation:** Enemies might try to detach cars to separate the party.

- **Strength Checks:** Detaching a car requires a DC 15 Strength check, or a DC 12 Dexterity check if using tools.
- **AC and HP of Train Connections:** Each connection between cars has AC 15 and 50 HP. These connections can be attacked to forcibly detach cars.

**Changing Scenery:** The environment outside the train can change, introducing new hazards or opportunities.

- **Descriptive Changes:** Describe changing landscapes that can impact visibility or introduce new threats (e.g., archers on a hillside).

## 4. Combat Strategies

**Ambushes and Surprise:** Enemies can hide in compartments, on the roof, or under the train.

- **Stealth Checks:** Enemies can make Dexterity (Stealth) checks to ambush the party. Successful checks result in a surprise round.

**Multi-Level Combat:** Encourage combat on multiple levels (inside cars, on the roof, between cars).

- **Vertical Movement:** Characters can use ladders, ropes, or acrobatics to move between levels.

**Interactive Environment:** Use the train’s features to create tactical options.

- **Cover:** Seats, cargo, and doors provide cover.
- **Hazards:** Broken windows, exposed machinery, and magical devices can be used creatively in combat.
