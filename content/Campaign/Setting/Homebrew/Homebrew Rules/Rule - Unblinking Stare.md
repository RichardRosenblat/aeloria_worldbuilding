# Rule: Unblinking Stare

"Ready. Set. Stare."- Mjordal's annual Blinking Competition's announcer

A character or creature can maintain an unblinking stare for a maximum number of rounds equal to its Constitution score. After reaching this limit, it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be compelled to blink. The DC for this saving throw is 10 + the number of rounds beyond the limit.

## Constitution Saving Throw:  
DC = 10 + (Number of rounds beyond the character's Constitution score)

## Effect of Failing the Saving Throw:  
If the creature fails the saving throw, it blinks involuntarily, ending its unblinking state. 

## Effect of Continuing to Stare:
For each round it goes without blinking beyond its limit, the creature suffers a cumulative -1 penalty on Perception checks and ranged attack rolls due to dryness and irritation.

## Example:  
If a character with a Constitution score of 14 attempts to maintain an unblinking stare for 16 rounds, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 12 (10 + 2). If the saving throw fails, the character blinks involuntarily. If the character continues to maintain an unblinking stare for 20 rounds, the DC for the saving throw increases to 16 (10 + 6).

At the 16th round, the character suffers a -2 penalty on Perception checks and ranged attack rolls. At the 20th round, the penalty increases to -5.
