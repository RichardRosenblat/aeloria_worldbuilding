## Rations and Water

Rations and water are essential for survival during long journeys. The following rules provide guidelines for tracking rations and water consumption during travel.

### Rations and Water Requirements

The rule for minimum rations and water required for travel is as follows:

**A creature consumes 1 ration(5 sp) per day of travel** 

_Be aware that this is the minimum amount of rations required for the long rests made at the end of day of travel. Aditional long rests will require additional rations._

Rations contain enough food and water to sustain a Medium creature for one day. Creatures above or below Medium size require different amounts of food and water per day.

The table below shows the number of rations required per day for creatures of different sizes:

| Size       | Rations/Day |
| ---------- | ------- |
| Tiny       | 0.25    |
| Small      | 0.5     |
| Medium     | 1       |
| Large      | 2       |
| Huge       | 3       |
| Gargantuan | 4+      |

### Foraging for Food and Water

If a creature is unable to find or purchase rations for any reason, it can attempt to forage for food and water during travel. **If the group is traveling in a slow pace, they can forage for food and water for the entire group** during the travel by making a Wisdom (Survival) check.

If the check is successful, the creature finds enough food and water to sustain their party for one day. If the check fails, the creature doesn't find enough food or water, and the party must rely on their remaining rations, if any. 

The DC for the check is determined by the availability of resources in their current terrain:

| Food and Water Availability	 | DC |
| ----------------------- | -- |
|Abundant food and water sources| 10 |
|Limited food and water sources	 | 15 |
|Very little, if any, food and water sources	| 20 |

If the party is traveling at a normal or fast pace, they can't forage for food and water during travel. But they can spend time foraging during a break of their travel, during a short or long rest. 

**The amount of food and water found by searching for resources during a rest is enough to sustain the creature searching** for one day. If the creature is searching for food and water for more than one creature, the creature must make a separate check for each creature and search in different locations. 

### Travelling Without Food or Water

If a creature doesn't have enough food or water, it must roll a Constitution saving throw at the end of the day. The DC is 10 + 1 for each day without food or water. On a failed save, the creature suffers one level of exhaustion.

## Events and Encounters

Traveling through the wilderness can be dangerous and unpredictable, but it can also be an opportunity for exploration and discovery. The following rules provide guidelines for generating events and encounters during travel.

### Encounter Frequency

The frequency of encounters during travel can vary based on the distance traveled and the scale of the journey. Use the following guidelines to determine the frequency of encounters:

| Scale        | Small Trip (1-3 Hexes)        | Medium Trip (4-6 Hexes)       | Long Trip (7+ Hexes)       |
| ------------ | ----------------------------- |:----------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Small Scale  | 1d4-2 (Minimum 0) or pick 0-2 | 1d4-1 (Minimum 2) or pick 2-3 | 1d6 (Minimum 3) or pick 3-6 |
| Big Scale | 1d4-1 (Minimum 1) or pick 1-3 | 1d4 (Minimum 3) or pick 3-4   | 1d6 (Minimum 4) or pick 4-6 |

### Encounter Types

To add variety to the journey, encounters can be categorized into different types based on their nature and focus. Use the following color code to categorize encounters:

- Red (Combat): These encounters involve battles with monsters or hostile NPCs that appear during the journey.
- Blue (Roleplay): These encounters involve interactions with friendly NPCs, encounters with merchants, or events between party members.
- Green (Exploration): These encounters involve discovering points of interest, uncovering hidden secrets, finding resources, landmarks, lore or ruins.

Examples of encounters by type:

- Red (Combat): A group of bandits ambushes the party on the road; a bear attacks the camp at night looking for food; a hired assassin tries to kill one of the party members for a bounty; a rival adventuring party challenges the group to settle a dispute.
- Blue (Roleplay): A traveling merchant offers to sell rare items to the party; a local farmer asks for help dealing with a pest problem; a mysterious stranger approaches the party with a cryptic message; a bard performs a song about the party and asks to tag along.
- Green (Exploration): The party discovers an ancient ruin hidden in the forest; the group finds a hidden cave beneath a fallen tree; a strange monolith appears in the distance; the party stumbles upon a group of small hovering mushrooms that seem to travel in their own journey.

### Selecting Encounter Colors

When generating encounters, roll a d12 to determine the color of the encounter. Use the following table to determine the color based on the roll:

| 1d12  | Color                          |
| ----- | ------------------------------ |
| 1-3   | Red (Combat)                   |
| 4-7   | Blue (Roleplay)                |
| 7-9   | Green (Exploration)            |
| 10-12 | Roll again and mix the results |

## Travel Time

Traveling from one location to another can be a significant part of an adventure, requiring time, resources, and careful planning. The following rules provide guidelines for determining travel times based on various factors such as terrain, pace, and mode of travel.

### Pace

When traveling, characters can choose from different paces based on their preferred speed and level of alertness. The following pacing descriptions provide guidelines for different travel speeds:

- **Fast Pace:**
  - Increased travel speed at the cost of reduced alertness.
  - Perception checks are made at disadvantage, suitable for urgent travel. 
  - -5 penalty to passive Wisdom (Perception) scores.
  - Can be maintained for 6 hours before requiring rest or causing exhaustion.
  - This pacing can be doubled for 1 hour but requires a rest afterwards or causes a immediate level of exhaustion.

- **Normal Pace:**
  - Standard rate of travel with balanced alertness and speed.
  - Allows for normal perception checks and covers a typical distance in a day.
  - Can be maintained for 8 hours without the need for rest or exhaustion.

- **Slow Pace:**
  - Careful and cautious travel allowing for thorough exploration.
  - Advantage on perception checks, suitable for activities like foraging.
  - This pace allows for the use of stealth.
  - Can be maintained for 12 hours before requiring rest or causing exhaustion.

#### Pacing Limitations, Forced March and Exhaustion (Only use for short travels)

When characters are traveling, they can only maintain a pace for a certain amount of time before they must take a long or short rest. If the party continues to travel without resting, they risk gaining levels of exhaustion. 

The party can choose to only take a short rest after the maximum travel time, but they must take a long rest after a certain amount of hours or risk gaining levels of exhaustion.

The following table provides guidelines for pacing limitations, rest requirements, and exhaustion DCs based on the chosen pace:

| Pacing Type  | Maximum Travel Time | Rest Required | Maximum Before Long Rest     | Exhaustion DC          |
| ------------ | ------------------- | ------------- | :--------------------------- | :--------------------- |
| **Doubled Fast** | 1 hour              | Long          | None                         | None                   |
| **Fast**         | 6 hours             | Short or Long | 3 hours (9 hours in total)   | 15 + 1 per hour forced |
| **Normal**       | 8 hours             | Short or Long | 8 hours (16 hours in total)  | 10 + 1 per hour forced |
| **Slow**         | 12 hours            | Short or Long | 12 hours (24 hours in total) | 10 + 1 per hour forced |


### Mounts and Vehicles

When traveling overland, characters can use mounts or vehicles to increase their speed and carry additional supplies. The following guidelines provide rules for using mounts and vehicles during travel:

When characters are traveling mounted, the rules for pacing and rest are similar but adjusted for the endurance of mounts. The following table provides guidelines for mounted pacing limitations, rest requirements, and DCs (animal handling) for mounts becoming uncooperative due to fatigue based on the chosen pace. If the mount becomes uncooperative, it refuses to travel further and requires a rest period equivalent to a long rest to recover.

| **Pacing Type**  | **Maximum Travel Time** | **Rest Required** | **Maximum Before Long Rest** | **Uncooperative DC**       |
|------------------|-------------------------|-------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Doubled Fast** | 2 hours                 | Long              | None                         | None                       |
| **Fast**         | 8 hours                 | Short or Long     | 4 hours (12 hours in total)  | DC 15 + 1 per hour forced  |
| **Normal**       | 10 hours                | Short or Long     | 10 hours (20 hours in total) | DC 10 + 1 per hour forced  |
| **Slow**         | 14 hours                | Short or Long     | 14 hours (28 hours in total) | DC 10 + 1 per hour forced  |

**Animal Mounts:** For short spans of time (up to an hour), many animals move much faster than humanoids. A mounted character can ride at a gallop for about an hour, covering twice the usual distance for a fast pace. If fresh mounts are available every 8 to 10 miles, characters can cover larger distances at this pace, but this is very rare except in densely populated areas.

**Land Vehicles:** Characters in wagons, carriages, or other land vehicles choose a pace as normal. Characters in a waterborne vessel are limited to the speed of the vessel (if any is specified, otherwise check the Travel Time Tables), and they don't suffer penalties for a fast pace or gain benefits from a slow pace. Depending on the vessel and the size of the crew, ships might be able to travel for up to 24 hours per day.

**Uncooperative Behavior:** If a mount becomes uncooperative, it refuses to travel further and requires a rest period equivalent to a long rest to recover.

**Handling Uncooperative Mounts:** A successful Animal Handling check (DC equal to the Uncooperative DC) can calm the mount temporarily, allowing for up to an additional hour of travel before another check is needed. Repeated forced travel increases the DC by 5 each hour.

#### Ship Types

When traveling by water, the type of ship used can significantly impact travel times and efficiency. The following ship types provide guidelines for different water vessels:

- **Small Ship:**
  - Typically nimble and able to navigate tighter spaces.
  - Suitable for rivers, coastal waters, and swamps.

- **Medium Ship:**
  - Balanced size, providing good speed and cargo capacity.
  - Versatile for various water terrains but limited in shallow waters.

- **Big Ship:**
  - Large vessels with significant cargo and passenger capacity.
  - Best for open sea and calm water, but limited in swamps and shallow waters.

#### Special Mounts and Vehicles

A character bestride a phantom steed, soaring through the air on a carpet of flying, or riding a sailboat or a steam-powered gnomish contraption doesn't travel at a normal rate, since the magic, engine, or wind doesn't tire the way a creature does and the air doesn't contain the types of obstructions found on land. When a creature is traveling with a flying speed or with a speed granted by magic, an engine, or a natural force (such as wind or a water current), translate that speed into travel rates using the following rules:

- In 1 minute, you can move a number of feet equal to your speed times 10.
- In 1 hour, you can move a number of miles equal to your speed divided by 10.
- For daily travel, multiply your hourly rate of travel by the number of hours traveled (typically 8 hours).
- For a fast pace, increase the rate of travel by one-third.
- For a slow pace, multiply the rate by two-thirds.

### Terrain Characteristic Descriptions

  - Adverse weather can reduce travel speed (e.g., +1 day/hex).
  - Favorable weather might increase travel speed (e.g., -1 day/hex).

- **Roads and Trails:**
  - Well-maintained roads can increase travel speed (e.g., -1 day/hex).
  - Difficult or dangerous trails might decrease speed (e.g., +1 day/hex).

- **Encumbrance:**
  - Carrying heavy loads can slow the party down, increasing travel time.

- **Currents and Tides:**
  - Favorable currents and tides can increase travel speed (e.g., -0.5 days/hex).
  - Unfavorable currents and tides can decrease travel speed (e.g., +0.5 days/hex).

- **Ship Condition and Crew:**
  - Well-maintained ships and experienced crew can increase travel speed. (e.g., -1 days/hex)
  - Poor ship condition and inexperienced crew can decrease travel speed. (e.g., +1 days/hex)

- **Mounts and Vehicles:**
  - Using horses or vehicles can increase travel speed, especially on suitable terrain. Check the rules for special travel pace below.
