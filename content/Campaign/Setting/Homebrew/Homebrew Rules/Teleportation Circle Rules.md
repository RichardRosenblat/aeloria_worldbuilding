# Teleportation Circle Rules

Teleportation Circles are a form of magical transportation that allows individuals to travel instantaneously between two locations. These circles are created through a complex ritual, and the process of establishing a permanent circle demands unwavering commitment from the caster. The following rules outline the mechanics and limitations of Teleportation Circles within the world of [[Aeloria]]

- **Geometric Precision:** The Teleportation Circle must maintain a perfect geometric configuration at all times, with all points aligned in a straight line, forming a two-dimensional plane. Any deviation from this precise arrangement, whether through folding or misalignment, renders the circle forever ruined.

- **Unique Sigils:** Each Teleportation Circle bears a unique sequence of sigils, chosen by its creator. Sigils can be any symbol that the user creates and remembers, but they must be unique. Most arcane institutions adhere to a standard practice of utilizing a combination of 20 spaces, each filled with one of 20 distinct symbols and runes, ensuring the integrity and security of the Teleportation Circle's enchantment.

- **Variability of Effects:** The nature of teleportation varies depending on the caster's expertise and magical origin. Some circles manifest as gateways between locations, while others form three-dimensional conduits or cylindrical fields that instantaneously transport all within their bounds.

- **Ritualistic Creation:** Establishing a Permanent Teleportation Circle demands unwavering commitment from the caster. Without fail, the ritual must be conducted daily in a consistent location for an entire year. This location denotes a specific surface, ensuring uniformity in the circle's placement. During each casting, the user designates a reference point—any object that contains elemental or magical energy—such as a crystal, stone, tree, or ley line. This reference always be the same for each teleportation circle and must reside within the same plane as the circle remaining stationary in relation to the circle throughout the ritual's duration. The caster must maintain visual contact with the reference point during the casting, ensuring alignment with the circle's position. While the ritual can be performed at any time within a 24-hour period, adherence to this schedule is paramount; any lapse resets the process, necessitating a complete restart. Upon the year's culmination, the Teleportation Circle attains permanence, enabling the caster to utilize its magic to teleport to it.

- **Mobility and Stability:** Although Teleportation Circles can be relocated, both the circle and its reference point must move in unison. Should one element be displaced without the other, the circle becomes permanently ruined.

- **Accessibility of Warp Pads:** Warp Pads, crafted from Pure Arcanite through perilous means, offer a universal means of teleportation. Unlike traditional circles, these pads require no reference point and can be utilized by individuals lacking any magical prowess.

- **Catastrophic Ruination:** Attempts to utilize a ruined Teleportation Circle result in calamitous consequences. Any endeavor to teleport to or from such a circle leads to unpredictable and potentially hazardous outcomes.

- **Surface and Medium:** Teleportation Circles may be inscribed upon any flat, stable surface using specialized materials such as arcane chalk, ink, or engraved markings. Once rendered permanent, their symbols resist conventional erasure, yielding only to dispelling magic or ruination.
