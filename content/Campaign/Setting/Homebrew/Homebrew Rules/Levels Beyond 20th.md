# Levels Beyond 20th: Expanding Your Multiclassing Journey

"It would be a waste of time to just sit around and wait for the end of the world. There was still so much to learn." - [[Merlin of The Stars]]

In this advanced rule for characters who have already reached level 20, players can continue to evolve their characters by further developing their multiclass abilities. This rule allows players to level up each of their multiclass options until all classes reach level 20. However, a single class cannot exceed level 20, avoiding the need to create new class features beyond level 20.

## Unlocking Levels Beyond 20th:

The cap of 20 character levels is a limitation that no mortal can surpass without the aid of powerful magic or divine intervention. To unlock levels beyond 20th, a character must undertake a special quest or seek out a powerful artifact or entity capable of granting them the power to break their own primordial limiter. The DM should design a challenging and epic quest that fits the character's story and the campaign's narrative. Once the character completes this quest, they gain the ability to progress beyond 20th level.

There are not many ways to unlock levels beyond 20th, some of them could be:
- Becoming a archlich.
- Making a pact with a extremely powerful entity.
- Being blessed by a god.
- Conquering a layer of a plane of existence.
- Encountering a world shaking artifact.

Many of those that achieve such power also gain some type of immortality, be either the undeath of a lich, or slowing down the aging process to a crawl. This is often needed to be able to gather the amount of experience needed to reach such levels.

## Experience Points (XP) Calculation for New Levels:

To progress to the next level beyond 20, players will need to calculate the XP threshold for each subsequent level. The formula is straightforward: multiply the amount of XP required to reach the previous level by 1.15 (a 15% increase). This will determine the XP needed to attain the next level.

**Example Calculation:**
- If a character required 355,000 XP to reach level 20, to determine the XP needed for level 21, multiply 355,000 by 1.15, resulting in 408,250 XP required for the next level.

## Maximum Character Level and Total XP:

While each class is capped at level 20, the maximum character level a player can achieve through multiclassing is 260. To reach this ultimate level, a character will need a staggering 131,132,408,494,626,260,000 XP (One hundred thirty-one quintillion, one hundred thirty-two quadrillion, four hundred eight trillion, four hundred ninety-four billion, six hundred twenty-six million, two hundred sixty thousand.). This total represents the cumulative XP required to level each class up to 20 across 13 classes.
