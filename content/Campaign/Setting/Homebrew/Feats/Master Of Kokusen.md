# Feat: Kokusen Mastery

*"It is said that the power of Kokusen is so great that it can shatter gargantuan boulders and carve holes through even the most durable of metals. The truth is, however, the the true might of Kokusen lies not in its destructive power, but in the sheer skill, discipline and precision required to execute it. It is a feat so rare that no one has ever been able to unleash more than four Kokusen in a row. To master Kokusen is to master oneself... or to be just a insanely lucky bastard." - Elder Monk of the Kokusen Temple*

***Prerequisite: Proficiency in a martial weapon, 2nd level Monk or 5th level Fighter.***

**Description:** Through unparalleled mastery of combat techniques, you have unlocked the legendary power of Kokusen, allowing you to unleash devastating strikes with supernatural speed and precision. Kokusen is a distortion in space that occurs when Ki energy is applied within 0.000001 seconds of a physical hit. When a monk is able to achieve this, their Ki flashes black, and the destructive power of their strike is equal to five times the normal hit. This feat represents the pinnacle of martial prowess and requires precise timing and mastery over one's Ki.

- **Requirement:** You must make a successful attack against a target with a unarmed strike or a melee weapon you are proficient with and roll a natural 20.
- **Effect:** When you hit a target with a weapon attack, and roll a natural 20, you can attempt to unleash the power of Kokusen. Roll a d20. If the result is a natural 20, you activate Kokusen. The damage dealt by the triggering attack is multiplied by 5.
- **Limitation:** After successfully activating Kokusen, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest. Additionally, you can only attempt to activate Kokusen a number of times equal to your Dexterity modifier (minimum of 1) per long rest.
