# Feat: Kokusen Mastery
*Prerequisite: Proficiency in a martial weapon, be a Monk of at least second level*

Through unparalleled mastery of combat techniques, you have unlocked the legendary power of Kokusen, allowing you to unleash devastating strikes with supernatural speed and precision.

**Description:** Kokusen is a distortion in space that occurs when Ki energy is applied within 0.000001 seconds of a physical hit. When a monk is able to achieve this, their ki flashes black, and the destructive power of their strike is equal to five times the normal hit. This feat represents the pinnacle of martial prowess and requires precise timing and mastery over one's ki.

- **Requirement:** You must make a successful weapon attack against a target with a melee weapon you are proficient with.
- **Effect:** When you hit a target with a weapon attack, and roll a natural 20, you can attempt to unleash the power of Kokusen. Roll a d20. If the result is a natural 20, you activate Kokusen. The damage dealt by the triggering attack is multiplied by 5.
- **Limitation:** After successfully activating Kokusen, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest. Additionally, you can only attempt to activate Kokusen a number of times equal to your Dexterity modifier (minimum of 1) per long rest.
