# Soft and Wet

"Shh... Soft and Wet."- Gappy, bard owner of the [[Soft and Wet (Nightclub)|Soft and Wet]].

*6th-level Conjuration*

**Classes:** Wizard, Sorcerer, Warlock  
**Casting Time:** 1 minute  
**Range:** Touch  
**Components:** V, S, M (a small vial of soapy water)  
**Duration:** 24 hours

## Description:
You create a magical mark on a surface or creature of your choice. This mark is invisible to the naked eye but can be detected with a successful Intelligence (Arcana) check against your spell save DC. 

At the time of casting, you specify a trigger condition and a direction for the bubbles to fly. When the specified condition is met, the mark releases a swarm of high-speed bubbles that act as if they were made of solid metal, flying toward the designated direction.

**Trigger Condition:** The trigger condition can be anything you specify, such as a spoken word, a specific time of day, or a certain action taken by a creature within 30 feet of the mark.

**Direction:** The direction can be general (e.g., "towards the nearest creature") or specific (e.g., "towards the first creature in front of the one that triggered the condition").

**Effect:**  
When the bubbles are triggered, they fly at high speed towards the specified direction, dealing bludgeoning damage to any creature they hit. The bubbles have the following effects:

- **Attack Roll:** The bubbles make a ranged spell attack against each creature in their path. You make a separate attack roll for each creature.
- **Damage:** On a hit, the target takes 6d8 bludgeoning damage and must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the target is knocked prone.
- **Area of Effect:** The bubbles travel in a straight line up to 60 feet from the mark. Any creature in this path can be hit by the bubbles.

## At Higher Levels:
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 6th.
