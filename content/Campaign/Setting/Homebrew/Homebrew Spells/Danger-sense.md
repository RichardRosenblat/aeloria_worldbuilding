*"Everyone! Get down!"*- A ranger, moments before a trap is sprung

# Danger-Sense

*2nd-level divination*

**Classes:** Wizard, Ranger, Sorcerer  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V, S, M (A spider's web between two small sticks)
**Duration:** 1 minute (Concentration)

## Description:
You call upon the primal instincts ingrained within you, heightening your senses to detect imminent danger. Upon casting this spell, a tingling sensation akin to a surge of electricity races down your spine, alerting you to potential threats.

For the duration of the spell, you gain the following benefits:

- You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see, such as traps and spells, as you instinctively dodge out of harm's way.

- You have advantage on initiative rolls, as you sense danger and react quicker than normal.

- You cannot be surprised while the spell lasts, as your heightened awareness alerts you to any potential ambushes or hidden assailants.

Furthermore, your enhanced senses grant you a precognitive awareness of nearby danger. You are subtly alerted to traps, incoming attacks, or nearby creatures with hostile intentions toward you. This awareness manifests as a faint tingling sensation at the back of your neck, guiding you to react swiftly and avoid harm.

## At Higher Levels:
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the duration increases by 10 minutes for each slot level above 2nd.
