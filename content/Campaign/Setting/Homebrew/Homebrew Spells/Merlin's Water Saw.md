*"Ahh, the 'Water Saw,' a relic of my earlier experimentation. It's effective, no doubt, particularly against those relentless zombie hordes. However, its indiscriminate nature leaves much to be desired. I must confess, it's a bit embarrassing to showcase such a crude creation to my students, especially one responsible for more than a few lost fingers."* - Merlin when interviewed about the spell

# Merlin's Water Saw

*5th-level evocation*

**Classes:** Wizard, Sorcerer, Druid
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** S, M (a pint of water, which the spell consumes)  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

## Description:
As you complete the somatic gestures and pour the pint of water into the air, the water begins to spin rapidly around you, forming a thin, translucent ring. The ring of water revolves around you at high speed, humming with magical energy.

- **Concentration:** While you maintain concentration on this spell, the water ring stays intact around you. Any creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of you takes 8d6 slashing damage as the water's high-speed rotation creates razor-sharp edges. Upon the end of the spell's duration, the water ring expands outward, as detailed below.
  
- **Expansion:** At any point during the spell's duration, you can drop your concentration to cause the water ring to expand. Upon doing so, the ring bursts outward in a 30-foot radius, centered on you. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 8d6 slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

- **Alteration:** Alternatively, instead of expanding the ring, you can use your action to move the ring to your hand and expand it at an angle. When you do this, you can place a 30-foot line with a height of 30 ft, originating from you or 5ft from you. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 8d6 slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

## Higher Levels:
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the initial and expansion damage both increase by 1d6 for each slot level above 4th.
