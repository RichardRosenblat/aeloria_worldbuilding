# Web Sling

*3rd-level Transmutation*

**Classes:** Sorcerer, Wizard, Druid, Warlock 
**Casting Time:** 1 bonus action  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V, S, M (a small spool of spider silk)  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

## Description:
You conjure strands of sticky, durable webbing that allow you to swing through the air, much like a spider. While the spell is active, you gain the following abilities:

- **Web Sling:** As a bonus action, you can shoot a strand of webbing to a point within 60 feet that can support your weight. This allows you to move to that point in a straight line, avoiding any obstacles in the path, without provoking opportunity attacks. You can use this ability to swing from object to object, giving you a movement speed of 60 feet while swinging. At the end of the movement, you can stay in the surface you landed but moving from it requires another bonus action to shoot another strand of webbing or you fall to the ground.

- **Web Snare:** As an action, you can shoot a strand of webbing at a creature within 30 feet. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be restrained by the webbing. A restrained creature can make a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check against your spell save DC at the end of each of its turns, freeing itself on a success. The webbing has an AC of 10 and 10 hit points, and is vulnerable to fire damage.

- **Web Barricade:** As an action, you can create a 10-foot cube of webbing at a point within 30 feet. This webbing acts as difficult terrain, and a creature entering or starting its turn in the webbing must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be restrained by it.
