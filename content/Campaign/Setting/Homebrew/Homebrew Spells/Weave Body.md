# Weave Form

*7th-level Transmutation*

**Classes:** Wizard, Sorcerer, Warlock  
**Casting Time:** 1 minute  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V, S, M (a piece of string)  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

## Description:
Upon casting this spell, your body composition transforms into a ball of string resembling a humanoid shape and appearance. You gain several unique abilities for the duration of the spell:

- **Unravel and Move:** You can unravel parts of your body, allowing you to move through spaces as thin as 1 inch wide without squeezing. This grants you the ability to bypass most physical barriers.
- **Extended Reach:** Your string-like body allows you to extend your attacks and spellcasting reach. You can make melee attacks and cast touch spells up to 30 feet away.
- **String Whip:** Your proficiency with whips is granted, and your string whip has an extended reach of 10 feet, dealing 1d8 slashing damage instead of the usual 1d4.
- **Improved Defense:** Your string form grants you a +3 bonus to AC, as it is harder to land precise hits on you.
- **Damage Vulnerability:** Any damage dealt to the string body is taken normally. However, you are vulnerable to slashing damage while in this form.
