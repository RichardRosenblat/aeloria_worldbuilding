# Pan's Ease

*"Honestly, I don't know how I ever cooked without it. It's like the pan does all the work for you!" - Pan, the culinary wizard*

*Cantrip Transmutation*

**Classes:** Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Touch  
**Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of salt)   
**Duration:** 1 hour 

## Description:
This cantrip allows the caster to enchant a cooking surface, such as a pan, making it magically resistant to food sticking. For the duration of the spell, any food cooked on the enchanted surface will not adhere to it, ensuring smooth cooking and easy cleaning. The enchanted surface appears to shimmer slightly with a faint, magical glow when the spell is active.

Additionally, the cooking process is enhanced, allowing for even heat distribution and preventing burning. The spell also imparts a gentle, pleasant aroma to the kitchen, reminiscent of fresh herbs and spices.
