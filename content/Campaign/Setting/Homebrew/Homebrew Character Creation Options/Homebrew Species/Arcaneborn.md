# The Arcaneborn: Living Manifestations of Magic

In the realms of Aloria, the Arcaneborn are beings shaped by the intricate dance of arcane forces. Born of ancient enchantments, they bear visual alterations reflecting their affinity for one of seven schools of magic: Abjuration, Conjuration, Divination, Enchantment, Illusion, Necromancy, and Transmutation. Marked by ethereal glows and shimmering eyes, they thrive in magical enclaves and faced a history of persecution with resilience. Each subrace embodies a distinct magical essence, from the guardians of Abjuration to the reality-shapers of Transmutation. The Arcaneborn's journey is one of self-discovery, acceptance, and the pursuit of balance in a world where magic is both wondrous and formidable.

## Appearance of the Arcane
Arcaneborn individuals exhibit distinctive magical alterations to their appearance. This might include ethereal glows, runes on their skin, blue skin or other magical manifestations.

## Knowledge among bretheren
Arcaneborn communities are often found in regions rich with magical energy, such as ancient ruins, arcane academies, or hidden enclaves in the heart of mystical forests. However, individual Arcaneborn can be found living among other races in diverse environments, drawn to places where the balance of magical forces is evident.

## Persecuted in old days
The Arcaneborn have a complex history, marked by the interplay of magical forces. In the past, their race faced persecution and misunderstanding due to their magical alterations. This history provides a rich backdrop for storytelling, allowing for themes of acceptance, redemption, and the consequences of wielding powerful magic. Additionally, conflicts may arise from the different magical schools, with rivalries and alliances shaping the dynamics of Arcaneborn society.

## Peaceful but wary
Arcaneborn often have a diplomatic stance with other races, as they understand the importance of maintaining a balance between different civilizations. However, their history of persecution has left some Arcaneborn wary of other races, particularly those who held prejudices against magic in older times. Interaction with other races may involve efforts to dispel myths and foster understanding.

### Magically inclined
Arcaneborn are naturally inclined toward classes that involve magic, such as wizards, sorcerers, and bards. Their affinity for different magical schools makes them versatile spellcasters. Backgrounds tied to academia, magical research, or mystical traditions align well with the Arcaneborn, reflecting their connection to the arcane arts.
  
The Arcaneborn's signature traits include Arcane Affinity, Tainted Form, and Arcane Knowledge. These traits collectively represent their inherent connection to magic, their visually distinctive appearances, and their proficiency in understanding arcane mysteries.
