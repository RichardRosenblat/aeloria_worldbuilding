# The Arcaneborn: Living Manifestations of Magic

In the realms of Aloria, the Arcaneborn are beings shaped by the intricate dance of arcane forces. Born of ancient enchantments that affected humanoid species, they bear visual alterations reflecting their affinity for one of seven schools of magic: Abjuration, Conjuration, Divination, Enchantment, Illusion, Necromancy, and Transmutation. Marked by ethereal glows and shimmering eyes, they thrive in magical enclaves and faced a history of persecution with resilience. Each subspecies embodies a distinct magical essence, from the guardians of Abjuration to the reality-shapers of Transmutation. The Arcaneborn's journey is one of self-discovery, acceptance, and the pursuit of balance in a world where magic is both wondrous and formidable.

## Appearance of the Arcane
Arcaneborn individuals exhibit distinctive magical alterations to their appearance. This might include ethereal glows, runes on their skin, blue skin or other magical manifestations. The degree of alteration varies among individuals, making each Arcaneborn visually unique. Their eyes might shimmer with magical energy, and when they cast spells, the arcane energy often manifests more visibly.
### Abjuration Arcaneborn:
_Warding Runes:_ Abjuration Arcaneborn may have intricate glowing runes on their skin, especially on their arms or forehead, symbolizing their affinity for protective magic.
_Auras of Shielding:_ They may have a faint, shimmering aura that becomes more pronounced when they use abjuration spells, serving as a visible sign of their defensive abilities.

### Conjuration Arcaneborn:

_Ephemeral Echoes:_ Their footsteps or movements may leave brief afterimages or echoes, emphasizing their connection to conjured entities.

### Divination Arcaneborn:
_Eyes of Foresight:_ Divination Arcaneborn could have cloudy eyes that glow with a soft, inner light, suggesting a constant awareness of future possibilities.
_Floating Symbols:_ Faint symbols or runes associated with divination might periodically appear and hover around them or in their forehead, responding to their heightened perception.

### Enchantment Arcaneborn:
_Hypnotic Gaze:_ Enchantment Arcaneborn may have eyes that appear mesmerizing or hypnotic, drawing attention to their persuasive nature.
_Aura of Charisma:_ An enchanting purple aura could radiate from them emanating magical musical notes.

_Prismatic Gleam:_ Their skin or hair may have a prismatic gleam, reflecting light in a rainbow around them.

## Knowledge among bretheren
Arcaneborn communities are often found in regions rich with magical energy, such as ancient ruins, arcane academies, or hidden enclaves in the heart of mystical forests. However, individual Arcaneborn can be found living among other species in diverse environments, drawn to places where the balance of magical forces is evident.

## Persecuted in old days
The Arcaneborn have a complex history, marked by the interplay of magical forces. In the past, their kind faced persecution and misunderstanding due to their magical alterations. This history provides a rich backdrop for storytelling, allowing for themes of acceptance, redemption, and the consequences of wielding powerful magic. Additionally, conflicts may arise from the different magical schools, with rivalries and alliances shaping the dynamics of Arcaneborn society.

## Peaceful but wary
Arcaneborn often have a diplomatic stance with other species, as they understand the importance of maintaining a balance between different civilizations. However, their history of persecution has left some Arcaneborn wary of other species, particularly those who held prejudices against magic in older times. Interaction with other species may involve efforts to dispel myths and foster understanding.

### Magically inclined
Arcaneborn are naturally inclined toward classes that involve magic, such as wizards, sorcerers, and bards. Their affinity for different magical schools makes them versatile spellcasters. Backgrounds tied to academia, magical research, or mystical traditions align well with the Arcaneborn, reflecting their connection to the arcane arts.
  
The Arcaneborn's signature traits include Arcane Affinity, Tainted Form, and Arcane Knowledge. These traits collectively represent their inherent connection to magic, their visually distinctive appearances, and their proficiency in understanding arcane mysteries.

## Arcane division
Each subspecies of the Arcaneborn is associated with a specific school of magic, influencing their abilities and strengths. The Abjuration Arcaneborn, for example, excels in defensive magic with the Warding Presence trait, making them resilient protectors. On the other hand, the Illusion Arcaneborn can cast the minor illusion cantrip, enhancing their abilities in deception and trickery. Each subspecies brings a unique flavor to the Arcaneborn, allowing players to tailor their characters to specific magical themes and playstyles.
