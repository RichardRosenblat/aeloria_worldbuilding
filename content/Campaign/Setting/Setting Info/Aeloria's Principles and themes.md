# Principles and themes of [[Aeloria]]

[[Aeloria]] is a world of balance, where the forces of light and dark, life and death, and self and other are inextricably linked. It is a realm where the past echoes through the present, and change is a constant companion. The magic of [[Aeloria]] is rooted in elemental forces, each with its unique powers and perils. These principles and themes shape the world of [[Aeloria]], guiding adventurers through its landscapes and mysteries.

## Theme:
High-fantasy focused on exploration of storylines, past and places

## Principles:

### Balance of Existence	
In [[Aeloria]], exists a grand tapestry of existence, woven from the threads of opposing and inseparable forces. It is a world where the very essence of balance reigns supreme, where every facet of existence is intricately linked to its counterpart, forming an unbreakable bond.

In this mystical realm, the dance of life and death is not a mere coincidence but a fundamental truth. Life flourishes, for it knows that without death, its meaning would be hollow. And in the embrace of death, there lies the promise of rebirth, for it is in death that life finds its purpose.

Light pierces the darkness, and in doing so, it gives rise to the shadows that define it. Without the veil of night, the brilliance of day would go unnoticed. Light and dark, eternally intertwined, shaping the very essence of our world.

The concept of self finds its meaning only in the presence of the other. Individuality exists because of the collective, and unity emerges from the diversity of the many. In this harmonious duality, every person, every creature, is not just a part of the world; they are the very essence of it.

In the grand design of our setting, all things are essential, and all beings are fundamentally interconnected. Just as a symphony requires each note to form its melody, so too does our world rely on the harmonious interplay of its contrasting elements. For it is in this balance that the true magic of our high fantasy story comes to life, a testament to the eternal truth that all things, and all people, are intrinsically fundamental to the tapestry of existence
	
### Continuity and Change	
In [[Aeloria]], a concept builds the lattice of time, one that weaves the delicate balance between continuity and change into the very fabric of our world. It is a principle that beckons us to understand the enduring presence of the past, even as it undergoes subtle transformations in the embrace of time.

In our realm, remnants of history persist, like forgotten toys left in an abandoned garden. They stand there, seemingly untouched by the ages, yet if one looks closely, they bear the marks of time's gentle hand. Colors fade, edges soften, and with each passing day, they become an echo of their former selves. It's a reminder that nothing remains untouched, that the past whispers its story in the subtle changes etched into the present.

But it's not just the passage of time that shapes our world. External forces, like [[The Moon (Aeloria's)|The Moon]] controlling the tides, remind us that stability is often an illusion. These cosmic influences, whether celestial or terrestrial, can sweep through our lives, disrupting the perceived tranquility and ushering change even when things seem unchanging.

This principle speaks to the very heart of our world—a world in a state of constant flux. It teaches us that even in the midst of change, some elements remain as they are, a testament to the enduring spirit of existence.

As time flows like a meandering river, history repeats itself, but in subtly different ways. It's a mesmerizing dance where the past and the present entwine, showing us that everything stays, and yet, everything changes. Civilizations come and go, cultures evolve, kingdoms are destroyed, and civilizations erased in an unending cycle, each chapter in history echoing the one before, yet eternally different. In the grand symphony of our world,

"Everything stays, but it still changes”
	
### Elements
In [[Aeloria]], all magic is comprised of at least one element of a list. They represent forces of nature and the cosmos, each with unique powers. Some elements are divided into different tiers based on their power and how ungovernable they are. However, excessive use of an element can lead to "affliction," causing negative transformations. Striking a balance is essential. The magical journey involves mastering the elements, exploring their potential, and avoiding their perils.

Magical elements are not just sources of power but also tools for perceiving the world around. Characters with elemental affinities can use their affinity with the elements to gain insights into their environment. For instance, a mage using the magic of the mind can detect the presence of sentient beings in an area, while a mage choosing to employ water magic can sense the proximity of bodies of water. This elemental perception allows mages to gain valuable insights and adapt to situations more effectively.

### The First is More Powerful but The Last is More Refined
In the world of [[Aeloria]], the first of a kind is often the most potent, embodying raw power and untamed potential. The first of a lineage, the first spells, the first species, the first energies – they all carry a primal strength that sets them apart from their successors. However, this raw power comes with a lack of refinement, a lack of control that can lead to unpredictable consequences. The first is a force of nature, a tempest waiting to be unleashed. 
And in contrast, the last of a kind is often the most refined, embodying the culmination of generations of knowledge and experience. The last of a lineage, the most recent spells, the last species, the last energies – they all carry a refined elegance that sets them apart from their predecessors. The last is a wellspring of wisdom, a font of knowledge that has been distilled into concentrated essence. However, this refinement comes with a lack of raw power, a lack of untamed potential that can limit their scope of influence. The last is a beacon of stability, a guiding light that illuminates the path ahead.

### Many Pasts, Many Proofs
Part of [[Aeloria]] is the existence of multiple pasts, each with its own truths and stories. Existence is defined by the colective and personal beliefs, and the past is no exception. The past is not a single, unchanging entity but a tapestry of many threads, each weaving its own narrative. With many different events, interpretations and correlations, the past is a complex and multifaceted entity that can be explored and understood in a myriad of ways. As one follows the thread of a past they can find many proofs of its existence, each one a piece of the puzzle that reveals a different aspect of a near incomprehensible whole.
