# Principles and themes

## Theme:
High-fantasy focused on exploration of storylines, past and places

## Principles:

### Balance of Existence	
In the realm of our D&D campaign, there exists a grand tapestry of existence, woven from the threads of opposing and inseparable forces. It is a world where the very essence of balance reigns supreme, where every facet of existence is intricately linked to its counterpart, forming an unbreakable bond.

In this mystical realm, the dance of life and death is not a mere coincidence but a fundamental truth. Life flourishes, for it knows that without death, its meaning would be hollow. And in the embrace of death, there lies the promise of rebirth, for it is in death that life finds its purpose.

Light pierces the darkness, and in doing so, it gives rise to the shadows that define it. Without the veil of night, the brilliance of day would go unnoticed. Light and dark, eternally intertwined, shaping the very essence of our world.

The concept of self finds its meaning only in the presence of the other. Individuality exists because of the collective, and unity emerges from the diversity of the many. In this harmonious duality, every person, every creature, is not just a part of the world; they are the very essence of it.

In the grand design of our campaign, all things are essential, and all beings are fundamentally interconnected. Just as a symphony requires each note to form its melody, so too does our world rely on the harmonious interplay of its contrasting elements. For it is in this balance that the true magic of our high fantasy story comes to life, a testament to the eternal truth that all things, and all people, are intrinsically fundamental to the tapestry of existence
	
### Continuity and Change	
In our campaign, a concept builds the lattice of time, one that weaves the delicate balance between continuity and change into the very fabric of our world. It is a principle that beckons us to understand the enduring presence of the past, even as it undergoes subtle transformations in the embrace of time.

In our realm, remnants of history persist, like forgotten toys left in an abandoned garden. They stand there, seemingly untouched by the ages, yet if one looks closely, they bear the marks of time's gentle hand. Colors fade, edges soften, and with each passing day, they become an echo of their former selves. It's a reminder that nothing remains untouched, that the past whispers its story in the subtle changes etched into the present.

But it's not just the passage of time that shapes our world. External forces, like [[The Moon (Aeloria's)]] controlling the tides, remind us that stability is often an illusion. These cosmic influences, whether celestial or terrestrial, can sweep through our lives, disrupting the perceived tranquility and ushering change even when things seem unchanging.

This principle speaks to the very heart of our world—a world in a state of constant flux. It teaches us that even in the midst of change, some elements remain as they are, a testament to the enduring spirit of existence.

As time flows like a meandering river, history repeats itself, but in subtly different ways. It's a mesmerizing dance where the past and the present entwine, showing us that everything stays, and yet, everything changes. Civilizations come and go, cultures evolve, kingdoms are destroyed, and civilizations erased in an unending cycle, each chapter in history echoing the one before, yet eternally different. In the grand symphony of our world,

"Everything stays, but it still changes”
	
### Elements
In my campaign, all magic is comprised of at least one element of a list. They represent forces of nature and the cosmos, each with unique powers. Some elements are divided into different tiers based on their power and how ungovernable they are. However, excessive use of an element can lead to "affliction," causing negative transformations. Striking a balance is essential. The magical journey involves mastering the elements, exploring their potential, and avoiding their perils.

Magical elements are not just sources of power but also tools for perceiving the world around. Characters with elemental affinities can use their affinity with the elements to gain insights into their environment. For instance, a mage using the magic of the mind can detect the presence of sentient beings in an area, while a mage choosing to employ water magic can sense the proximity of bodies of water. This elemental perception allows mages to gain valuable insights and adapt to situations more effectively.

### The Loves
In my Dungeons and Dragons campaign, one of the central themes is the universal existence of love in all things of the universe. It is a belief that transcends cultures, races, and even species, emphasizing that every single entity, whether great or small, possesses love in one or more of its myriad forms. This concept of love is not exclusive, and none of these forms prohibit individuals from feeling other types simultaneously. Instead, they exist in harmony, revealing themselves in varying degrees within each being. Some forms of love are a constant presence in a person's heart, while others may never find a place within them. This balance is essential, for sometimes, being consumed by one or more forms of love or being devoid of most types can lead to personal strife and even cause problems for others. It's also noteworthy that seemingly opposing forms of love can coexist within an individual's mind.
#### These are the ten distinct types of love that shape the tapestry of my D&D world:
1. **Romantic Love**: This type of love is not limited to affection for individuals alone; it can extend to objects or even abstract concepts. It encompasses both sexual and romantic love, and it's entirely possible for someone to experience this form of love for multiple individuals or things simultaneously.
2. **Affectionate Love**: A deep, platonic love that transcends mere friendship. It involves a profound sense of appreciation and affection for someone or something, reflecting the beauty of companionship without romantic or sexual intentions.
3. **Passionate Love**: This form of love is directed outward, beyond the self. It entails a passionate devotion to moral ideals, causes, or entities, often motivating individuals to take action for something greater than themselves.
4. **Self-Love**: The love for oneself, characterized by vanity and self-appreciation. It's essential for individuals to have a healthy level of self-care, but when it becomes excessive, it can lead to arrogance and narcissism.
5. **Universal Love**: An all-encompassing love that extends to everything and everyone, transcending the boundaries of groups or affiliations. It's a boundless, unconditional love and appreciation for existence.
6. **Communal Love**: Love for a specific community, be it friends, family, or a particular group. It fosters a sense of belonging and deep attachment to the shared experiences and bonds within that community.
7. **Ephemeral Love**: This is uncommitted love, free from expectations and not designed to endure. It's often fleeting and momentary, allowing individuals to experience brief connections without long-term commitments.
8. **Enduring Love**: This is lasting love, enduring love is committed and carefully considered. It forms everlasting bonds that withstand the tests of time, representing a profound commitment to someone or something.
9. **Aesthetic Love**: Love for the beauty or appearance of someone or something, grounded in the sensory experiences it invokes. It's a love driven by the aesthetics and sensory pleasures that an object or person provides.
10. **Abstract Love**: This form of love transcends the tangible and sensory. It's a love for the deeper meaning that something or someone carries, focusing on the intangible qualities and significance they hold.
