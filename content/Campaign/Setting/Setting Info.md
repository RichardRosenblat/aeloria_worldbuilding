# Setting Info and links

This setting, known as [[Aeloria]], is a world of balance, where the forces of light and dark, life and death, and self and other are inextricably linked. It is a realm where the past echoes through the present, and change is a constant companion. The magic of [[Aeloria]] is rooted in elemental forces, each with its unique powers and perils. These principles and themes shape the world of [[Aeloria]], guiding adventurers through its landscapes and mysteries.

It is a world designed for Dungeons and Dragons 5th edition, and it takes place in a homebrew world with some [[Custom Homebrew]] rules, options, and lore.
