# Principles and themes

## Theme:
High-fantasy focused on exploration of storylines, past and places

## Principles:

### Balance of Existence	
In Aeloria, exists a grand tapestry of existence, woven from the threads of opposing and inseparable forces. It is a world where the very essence of balance reigns supreme, where every facet of existence is intricately linked to its counterpart, forming an unbreakable bond.

In this mystical realm, the dance of life and death is not a mere coincidence but a fundamental truth. Life flourishes, for it knows that without death, its meaning would be hollow. And in the embrace of death, there lies the promise of rebirth, for it is in death that life finds its purpose.

Light pierces the darkness, and in doing so, it gives rise to the shadows that define it. Without the veil of night, the brilliance of day would go unnoticed. Light and dark, eternally intertwined, shaping the very essence of our world.

The concept of self finds its meaning only in the presence of the other. Individuality exists because of the collective, and unity emerges from the diversity of the many. In this harmonious duality, every person, every creature, is not just a part of the world; they are the very essence of it.

In the grand design of our setting, all things are essential, and all beings are fundamentally interconnected. Just as a symphony requires each note to form its melody, so too does our world rely on the harmonious interplay of its contrasting elements. For it is in this balance that the true magic of our high fantasy story comes to life, a testament to the eternal truth that all things, and all people, are intrinsically fundamental to the tapestry of existence
	
### Continuity and Change	
In Aeloria, a concept builds the lattice of time, one that weaves the delicate balance between continuity and change into the very fabric of our world. It is a principle that beckons us to understand the enduring presence of the past, even as it undergoes subtle transformations in the embrace of time.

In our realm, remnants of history persist, like forgotten toys left in an abandoned garden. They stand there, seemingly untouched by the ages, yet if one looks closely, they bear the marks of time's gentle hand. Colors fade, edges soften, and with each passing day, they become an echo of their former selves. It's a reminder that nothing remains untouched, that the past whispers its story in the subtle changes etched into the present.

But it's not just the passage of time that shapes our world. External forces, like [[The Moon (Aeloria's)|The Moon]] controlling the tides, remind us that stability is often an illusion. These cosmic influences, whether celestial or terrestrial, can sweep through our lives, disrupting the perceived tranquility and ushering change even when things seem unchanging.

This principle speaks to the very heart of our world—a world in a state of constant flux. It teaches us that even in the midst of change, some elements remain as they are, a testament to the enduring spirit of existence.

As time flows like a meandering river, history repeats itself, but in subtly different ways. It's a mesmerizing dance where the past and the present entwine, showing us that everything stays, and yet, everything changes. Civilizations come and go, cultures evolve, kingdoms are destroyed, and civilizations erased in an unending cycle, each chapter in history echoing the one before, yet eternally different. In the grand symphony of our world,

"Everything stays, but it still changes”
	
### Elements
In Aeloria, all magic is comprised of at least one element of a list. They represent forces of nature and the cosmos, each with unique powers. Some elements are divided into different tiers based on their power and how ungovernable they are. However, excessive use of an element can lead to "affliction," causing negative transformations. Striking a balance is essential. The magical journey involves mastering the elements, exploring their potential, and avoiding their perils.

Magical elements are not just sources of power but also tools for perceiving the world around. Characters with elemental affinities can use their affinity with the elements to gain insights into their environment. For instance, a mage using the magic of the mind can detect the presence of sentient beings in an area, while a mage choosing to employ water magic can sense the proximity of bodies of water. This elemental perception allows mages to gain valuable insights and adapt to situations more effectively.

## Symbolic Motifs

In the world of Aeloria, certain recurring symbols, known as symbolic motifs, play a practical role in guiding adventurers through its landscapes.

**Cakes are lies:**
The symbolic motif "Cakes are lies" weaves a subtle tapestry of deceit and hidden truths. When a character offers cakes, it signifies more than just a sweet treat. It becomes a warning to adventurers that a deceptive nature may lurk beneath a seemingly pleasant surface. A bakery devoid of cakes might be an unusual beacon of honesty, where the absence of this confectionary indulgence signals a space where truth prevails. This motif acts as an unspoken language among those attuned to the subtleties of Aeloria, guiding them through encounters where illusions and falsehoods may cloud the path.

**Bathtubs are safe:**
The symbolic motif "Bathtubs are safe" unfurls a narrative of security and refuge. Encountering a well-kept bathtub in an area suggests a haven of safety, a sanctuary where the tumultuous tides of danger are held at bay. A homely dwelling with an intact bathtub serves as a beacon for those seeking respite and protection. Conversely, a broken or shattered bathtub within a locale communicates a stark warning – the safety once offered has been compromised, and the shelter that was is no more. This motif silently guides adventurers through the uncharted territories of Aeloria, offering a unique language of safety and peril.

**Mirrors, Lakes, and The Moon are closely related:**
The symbolic motif "Mirrors, Lakes, and The Moon are closely related" introduces a triad of interconnected elements that ripple through the fabric of the world. Mirrors, when encountered, reflect more than mere images; they echo the ties between realms and offer glimpses into hidden truths. Lakes, as serene bodies of water, mirror the cosmic dance of celestial bodies and hold a connection to the ebb and flow of mystical forces. The Moon, a celestial guardian overhead, weaves its influence through reflective surfaces and tranquil waters. Together, these elements form an enigmatic trio, guiding adventurers to unveil secrets intertwined with the cosmic harmony of Aeloria. A mirrored lake beneath the moonlit sky becomes a nexus where the threads of fate are delicately woven, urging those attuned to this motif to explore the profound connections that transcend the mundane.
