# Welcome to [[Aeloria]]!

Hello there, explorer!!! üåç‚ú®

## About [[Aeloria]]
This a worldbuilding project, a world from my imagination and love for storytelling and Tabletop Role-Playing Games. [[Aeloria]] is a high-fantasy realm filled with tales of magic, mystery, and exploration. As the Dungeon Master, I craft its narrative, introducing new storylines, characters, and places. This wiki serves as a repository of knowledge about [[Aeloria]], a place where adventurers can immerse themselves in its lore and embark on epic quests.

## Endless Exploration
[[Aeloria]] is a canvas shaped by [[Aeloria's Principles and themes|principles]] like: Balance of Existence, Elements, and Continuity and Change and many others. These principles guide the creation of its lore, ensuring a cohesive and immersive experience for adventurers. The realm is a tapestry woven with intricate details, waiting to be explored. It's a place where the cosmos, gods, and mortals intertwine, creating a rich tapestry of stories and legends that grows with each new discovery, adventure, and campaign.

## [[Aeloria]]'s Future
This journey is just starting, [[Aeloria]] has a long way to go and a bright future ahead. The realm will continue to evolve, with new stories, characters, and locations waiting to be discovered. The wiki will be updated regularly, offering fresh insights into the world of [[Aeloria]]. The goal is to create a deeply developed and engaging Dungeons & Dragons setting, that can be enjoyed by players and Dungeon Masters alike, inspiring new ideas and adventures. I plan to develop campaigns, adventures, and other resources that will allow players to dive into the world of [[Aeloria]], experiencing its wonders firsthand. My hope is that this realm will last for many years, providing a framework for countless adventures and stories to come.

## The Nexus of Adventure: [[Aeloria]]'s Centers
In [[Aeloria]]'s vast expanse, you'll find mysterious locales known as "Centers." These are hubs where destiny intertwines, serving as focal points for exploration and campaigns. From epic quests to intricate storylines, Centers are dynamic stages where [[Aeloria]] as a setting unfolds. Currently the only center in the wiki is The Veiled Lands, but more will be added in the future.  

## [[Aeloria]] Wiki Navigation: A Quick Tip
For a deep dive into [[Aeloria]]'s lore, I suggest using a computer to explore the wiki. Larger screens provide a canvas where details can be showcased in their entirety, allowing for a more immersive experience.
On bigger screens, new components will appear to guide you through the notes that shape [[Aeloria]]'s narrative. This allows for a smooth journey through the realm.

## Exploring the dm_notes
Venture into pages marked as `#dm_note`, they are a glimpse into my messy notes, where many loose ideas and concepts are stored. These notes are a compilation of raw ideas and unfinished thoughts, waiting to be used in the worldbuilding process. Although. keep in mind these texts here may not be immediately coherent. Consider them as pages of one of my notebooks, where I jot down ideas, concepts, and inspirations before carrying them over to the main narrative.

## Embracing the Art of Worldbuilding with a Robotic Helper
Crafting narratives is both an art and a challenge. In the case of [[Aeloria]], I've embraced the power of AI to assist in the worldbuilding process. By using AI tools, such as GPT and github Copilot, I've been able to streamline my thoughts and make my texts more coherent, something I struggle with. While the AI helps in generating content and words, it's my hand that shapes the final narrative, ensuring that the essence of [[Aeloria]] remains true to my vision. I do not claim authorship of any content here, as much of it is either deeply inspired by other works or generated by AI, with few exceptions. My goal is to create a world that is intriguing and fits my vision, none of it is meant to be commercial or to infringe on any copyrights.

## Inspirations and Intentions
It's important to note that [[Aeloria]] is not a 100% original project. It draws inspiration from many of my favorite pieces of media, influencing elements such as the names of the [[True Gods]], [[The Planes|planes]], and more. This realm is a labor of love, a homage to the creativity of other media that has shaped who I am. It's not intended as a commercial endeavor; [[Aeloria]] is a passion project meant for exploration, storytelling, and the joy of worldbuilding. Should the unlikely event arise where [[Aeloria]] becomes a source of revenue, I am committed to making any necessary adjustments to avoid causing trouble for those who have inspired this fantastical journey. The aim is to celebrate and share the joy of storytelling, ensuring respect for the origins that have contributed to [[Aeloria]]'s tapestry.

**Image Credits: Appreciating Artistic Inspiration**

The images used in this wiki are not my own creations. They are sourced from talented artists who have shared their work online. None of the images are intended for commercial use, and I do not claim ownership of them. As I continue to expand [[Aeloria]], I will strive to credit the artists whose work has inspired the realm's visual representation. As I am not a professional artist, I rely on the creativity of others to bring the world of [[Aeloria]] to life. As I keep expanding and revisiting the wiki, I will work to ensure that the artists behind the images receive the credit they deserve.

## More on the generation notes
Among the notes, you might come across pages adorned with the tag `#generation`‚Äîconsider these the raw building blocks of the realm. These notes aren't immediately coherent, but rather, they serve as the propmts for me to use when generating content with AI. Tagged with this label, they encompass everything from commands sent to the AI to generate new information to meticulously crafted tables of contents. These elements play a crucial role in the continuous evolution of [[Aeloria]], acting as the seeds from which new details sprout and breathe life into the ever-expanding narrative.

## About me

Hey there, fellow wanderers! I'm known as Rychlost (*pronounced Rick-lost*). The origins of this name go back to my middle school days, inspired by role-playing adventures. It stuck with me like a good spell.

In the everyday world, I wear the hat of a software developer. I enjoy the cosmos, the deep ocean, exploration, puzzles, and fantasy realms (as you might have guessed).

The love for worldbuilding sparked during Dungeons & Dragons sessions with friends at recess in high-school. Since then, I've been enjoying creating different realms, but most didn't last much, being forgotten after a campaign. 

[[Aeloria]] is different, it came to exist during the middle of 2023, and I've been expanding on it ever since. I want for it to be a world beyond the dice, the pens and papers.
