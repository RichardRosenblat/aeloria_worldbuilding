## About me

Hey there, fellow wanderers! I'm known as Rychlost (*pronounced Rick-lost*). The origins of this name go back to my middle school days, inspired by role-playing adventures. It stuck with me like a good spell.

In the everyday world, I wear the hat of a software developer. I enjoy the cosmos, the deep ocean, exploration, puzzles, and fantasy realms (as you might have guessed).

The love for worldbuilding sparked during Dungeons & Dragons sessions with friends at recess in high-school. Since then, I've been enjoying creating different realms, but most didn't last much, being forgotten after a campaign. 

[[Aeloria]] is different, it came to exist during the middle of 2023, and I've been expanding on it ever since. I want for it to be a world beyond the dice, the pens and papers.
