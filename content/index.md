# Welcome to [[Aeloria]]!

Hey there, explorer! üåç‚ú®

## About [[Aeloria]]
This isn't just a blog; it's a creative project, a world spun from my imagination and fueled by creativity. [[Aeloria]] is a high-fantasy realm filled with tales of magic, mystery, and exploration. As the Dungeon Master, I craft its narrative, introducing new storylines, characters, and places.

## Endless Exploration
[[Aeloria]] is a canvas shaped by the principles of Balance of Existence, Elements, and Continuity and Change. Dive into a world where opposing forces harmonize, magic blends with elemental energies, and the past subtly transforms. Every bit of history is a clue, every change a testament to the enduring, ever-changing nature of existence.

## [[Aeloria]]'s Future
This journey is just beginning, with grand plans for [[Aeloria]]'s future. It's not just a blog; it's a stepping stone to further adventures. The goal is to expand this world over the years, turning it into a rich and immersive Dungeons & Dragons setting. Perhaps there will be books, stories, and realms yet undiscovered.

## Embracing the Art of Words with a Robotic Assistant
In the expansive realm of [[Aeloria]], crafting narratives is both an art and a challenge. As the maker of this world, I use AI as a silent collaborator, refining and structuring my thoughts into coherent texts.

## The Nexus of Adventure: [[Aeloria]]'s Centers
In [[Aeloria]]'s vast expanse, you'll find mysterious locales known as "Centers." These are hubs where destiny intertwines, serving as focal points for exploration and campaigns. From epic quests to intricate storylines, Centers are dynamic stages where [[Aeloria]] unfolds.

## Exploring the dm_notes
Venture into pages marked as `#dm_note`, they are a glimpse into my creative process. These notes are a compilation of raw ideas, a repository of untamed inspiration waiting to be shaped into [[Aeloria]]'s narrative. Beware, for the texts here may not be immediately coherent. Consider these pages a repository of inspiration, waiting to be shaped into [[Aeloria]]'s narrative.

## About me

Hey there, fellow wanderers! I'm known as Rychlost (*pronounced Rick-lost*). The origins of this name go back to my middle school days, inspired by role-playing adventures. It stuck with me like a good spell.

In the everyday world, I wear the hat of a software developer. I enjoy the cosmos, the deep ocean, exploration, puzzles, and fantasy realms (as you might have guessed).

The love for worldbuilding sparked during Dungeons & Dragons sessions with friends at recess in high-school. Since then, I've been enjoying creating different realms, but most didn't last much, being forgotten after a campaign. 

[[Aeloria]] is different, it came to exist during the middle of 2023, and I've been expanding on it ever since. I want for it to be a world beyond the dice, the pens and papers.
