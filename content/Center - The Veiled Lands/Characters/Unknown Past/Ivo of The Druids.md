Ivo is one of the members of the legendary party that fought back the Fiendish Incursion, along with the now [[Arthur Pendragon Of Camelot|King Arthur]] Pendragon of Camelot and [[Merlin of the Stars]]. 

1.  **Fiendish Incursion Hero**: Fought alongside [[Arthur Pendragon Of Camelot|King Arthur Pendragon]] and [[Merlin of the Stars]] to repel the Fiendish Incursion, a legendary battle that safeguarded the realms from an invasion of demons and devils. 
2. **Archdruid Ascendancy**: Achieved the esteemed rank of Archdruid, known for his unparalleled wisdom and power although never officially recognized by the druidic council due to his revolutionary activities, it is widely acknowledged by the druidic circles that his power and wisdom surpasses that of any other druid in history.
3. **Revolutionary Druid**: Inspired the anarchist revolution that overthrew the druidic government, championing freedom and justice for all druids and nature itself.
4. **Militia Founder**: Created and led militias that invaded druidic noble palaces, dismantling corrupt regimes with sword and spell, carrying the title of the Green Knight of the Wild Hunt and True Beheader as he killed more nobles than any other in history.
5.  **Wielder of the [[Yggdrasil's Morphblade]]**: Harnessed the power of the Vestige of [[Melora, Goddess of the Wild and Sea - The Wildmother (N)|Melora]], the legendary [[Yggdrasil's Morphblade]], to defend and empower his allies.
6. **Dragon Slayer**: When Ancient Dragons, metalic and chromatic alike, threatened the natural order, he single-handedly defeated them, besting the dragons both in combat and in wisdom.
7. **Healer of Empires**: Used his profound skills in medicine and natural magic to heal entire empires, restoring life and balance to vast lands.
8. **Veilshroud Seas Conqueror**: Successfully navigated the treacherous, uncharted veilshroud seasâ€”four deadly seas that surround the Veiled Lands and had claimed the lives of all others who attempted the journey.
9. **Global Druidic Explorer**: Traveled to all the veiled lands and beyond, meeting druidic circles across the world gathering knowledge and teaching the ways of the druids to areas that had never seen a druid before. He fought against other institutions that sought to control nature and the druids, creating more self-sufficient and independent druidic circles that valued nature and freedom.
10. **World Tree Embodiment**: Became the living embodiment of Yggdrasil, the world tree, connecting all realms through his existence and ultimately merged with Yggdrasil itself, becoming the [[material plane]]'s manifestation of the world tree and its boundless power.
