Aurelius Malum

he is a very powerful devil that hides in a tallman form and he controls a underground kingdom of devils that behave like him 
he aims to control and destroy surface dwelling society by making tallmen, kings and more bargain their souls to [[the nine hells]] with cunning, threats, war and blackmailing 
he has two powerful skills that one can only have if they are blessed by the [[Over-Deities]] themselves many people call him "The honored one" or "The blessed one"

why he does all this?  he got a agreement with [[Asmodeus, God of Tyranny - The Lord of the Nine Hells (LE)|asmodeus]] to proceed with his plans, and that he was born knowing his greatness, and that his role is to trick, destroy and consume in name of [[the nine hells]], not because he wants revenge, but because that is his nature, defined from the moment he was born and who is he to deny himself of his own role imposed on him by the gods above? after all he must have gotten these gifts for a reason, and that reason must be because the gods want him to succeed

His appearance is that of an androgenous tallman with a beautiful face, yet slightly inhuman being somewhat uncanny, and long golden hairs that cascate to his back, his eyes are a golden and his pupils that of a cat. from his forehead, two horns grow, and his skin is a smooth pale white, he wears royal clothing and a crown of gold and rubies, his voice is soft and sweet, but his words are always filled with venom and malice, he always carries with him his sword, a blade of pure black metal that is said to be a gift from [[Asmodeus, God of Tyranny - The Lord of the Nine Hells (LE)|asmodeus]] himself

His blessings:

![[The Greater Limit#^033529]]

His speech to the group: 
"I find it intriguing, the simplicity of wonder. The ability to ponder the vastness of our world, the cosmos, and the souls within it. So, allow me to pose a question. Do you, in your deepest contemplation, ponder my motives? Or seek to unravel the enigma that is my true identity beyond this antagonistic facade? You see, I was not born into uncertainty; I awoke and I knew who I was "am", A.M. Not merely for Aurelius Malum. But more fundamentally "Scio Ergo Sum".-I know, therefore I am. Thus I harbor no need to wonder, I know I am blessed, I know I am powerful, I know I am the one who will bring the world to its knees.

I alone stand above all others in the multiverse. This is not vanity, this is an undeniable fact. At birth, I was graced with the two highest blessings that mortal can attain, gifts that can bestowed only by the [[Over-Deities]] themselves. This cannot be without purpose. I must deserve this, and the gods must want me to succeed in whatever I desire. So I shall put a leash on the world, and I shall compel it to acknowledge its rightful place beneath me. And you, will bow before your king, willingly or I will break you until you do so."
