**Adder Stone**

_Wondrous Item (gemstone), rare_

_Description:_ The Adder Stone is a smooth and polished river rock with a naturally occurring hole at its center. This mystical gem is often found near rivers that have been touched by the ley lines and flow of ancient energies, and its formation is considered a rare and auspicious event.

_Properties:_

- **Addersight:** While peering through the central hole of the Adder Stone, the user gains the extraordinary ability known as Addersight.
    
- **Enhanced Vision:** Addersight grants the user the ability to see in both normal and magical darkness, as if bathed in a subtle, otherworldly light.
    
- **Invisibility Detection:** The user gains the power to discern the outlines of invisible creatures and objects as glimmering golden light.
    
- **Illusion Mastery:** Addersight bestows advantage on detecting visual illusions, as well as advantage on saving throws against them.
    
- **Ethereal Gaze:** Perhaps the most extraordinary aspect of Addersight is its ability to allow the user to see into the [[Ethereal Plane]]. This grants them the power to witness beings and phenomena that exist beyond the boundaries of the material world.
    

_Legend and Lore:_ The Adder Stone is steeped in legend and is often associated with ancient seers who could navigate the darkness of the night as easily as day.


_Usage:_ The Adder Stone is a versatile tool, sought after by wizards delving into the mysteries of the cosmos, rogues mastering the art of stealth and perception, and adventurers seeking to explore the hidden realms beyond the [[material plane]].
