**The Lantern**

*Wondrous Item (Hooded Lantern), Very Rare (Requires Attunement)*

**Activation word**: Vakna

**Appearance**

The Lantern initially appears as an ordinary hooded lantern, featuring tainted green glass around the light source. When attuned and lit, the flame within transforms into a humanoid figure gracefully dancing alone.

**Basic Functionality**

In its basic state, the lantern functions as a typical hooded lantern, casting light in a 30ft radius and dim light for an additional 30ft. It burns for 6 hours on a pint of oil, and as an action, the user can lower the flame, casting dim light in a 5ft radius.

**Activation and Transformation**

Upon uttering the activation word, the flame intensifies, triggering an illusion. The lantern's appearance transforms into the head of a humanoid significant to the attuned user, reflecting how the user remembers that person. The only alteration is the glowing green pupils. The head is visible and audible to everyone in a 30ft radius, with the lantern's light now creating dim light in a 5ft radius.

**Communication and Knowledge**

The illusionary head can speak all languages understood by the user and mirrors the personality of the original person. It is compelled to truthfully answer questions posed by the attuned user. If the head lacks a mouth, it communicates telepathically with all present creatures. The user can inquire about the world, lore, or history, and the head responds to the best of its ability.

**Limitations and Dismissal**

The head only possesses knowledge of things witnessed by the lantern or known by its creator. It cannot be harmed by any means and can only be dispelled in a dead magic zone. The illusion lasts for 1 hour or until dismissed by the user, after which the lantern reverts to its original appearance, and the flame returns to its initial brightness. The Lantern cannot be used again until the next dawn.
