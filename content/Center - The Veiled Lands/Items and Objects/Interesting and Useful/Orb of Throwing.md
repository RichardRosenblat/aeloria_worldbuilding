# Name: Orb of Throwing

## Description:
The Orb of Throwing is a simple, spherical focus, approximately the size of a grapefruit, that constantly hovers around its attuned spellcaster. If it is not attuned, it hovers in place whenever a spellcaster is within 5 feet, falling to the floor otherwise. The orb is made of a smooth and opaque, crystal-like material that shimmers when light hits it.

When commanded, it can strike enemies with formidable force and deliver elemental damage. Additionally, the orb can be used as a spellcasting focus.

## Rarity and Type:
*Very Rare Wondrous Item*

## Requirements:
*Requires attunement by a spellcaster*

## Attunement:
*Yes*

## Properties:
- **Spellcasting Focus:** The Orb of Throwing can be used as a spellcasting focus for the attuned spellcaster.
- **Elemental Affinity:** Upon attunement, roll on the Elemental Damage Table to determine the orb's elemental damage type, its corresponding appearance and a minor effect it creates.

## Activation:
- **Command Attack:** As an action, the attuned user can command the orb to fly towards an enemy within 30 feet and make a spell attack roll. On a hit, the enemy takes 3d6 bludgeoning damage and 1d4 damage of the predefined elemental type from the table below.

## Effects:

| ---- | --------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | **Thunder**     | The orb becomes opaque like it is made of stone and vibrates with a deep, resonant hum.                                       | Creates a 10-foot radius of deep, resonant hum that can be heard faintly, if left upon a surface it vibrates and jumps slightly. |
| 2    | **Bludgeoning** | The orb appears solid and metallic, with a heavy, weighty feel.                                                               | For anyone other than the attuned user, the orb feels heavy and difficult to lift.                                               |
| 3    | **Cold**        | The orb becomes translucent, appearing to be made of an thin, icy shell that creates frost and holds mist within.             | It is cold to the touch and leaves a thin layer of frost on objects within 8 inches (20cm) of the orb.                           |
| 4    | **Fire**        | The orb becomes opaque it's surface appears to be made of cooling magma, with flickering innofensive flames dancing above it. | It is warm to the touch and leaves scorch marks on objects within 4 inches (10cm) of the orb.                                    |
| 5    | **Force**       | The orb becomes transparent it's surface appears to be made of a glass-like crystal with a pulsating white light inside.      | Causes dim light to emanate from the orb, illuminating a 5-foot (1 square) radius around it.                                     |
| 6    | **Lightning**   | The orb becomes opaque and metalic, as it crackles with blue lightning that arcs across its surface.                          | Causes faint and innofensive archs to jump to nearby objects within a 5 inch (13cm) radius of the orb.                           |
| 7    | **Necrotic**    | The orb transforms into a skull-like shape made of dark crystal and emits a dark, shadowy aura.                               | Uninteligible whispers can be heard when the orb is within 10 inches (25cm) and it stains objects with a black residue.          |
| 8    | **Piercing**    | The orb transforms into a spiked, jagged shape that appears to be made of metal.                                              | The spikes on the orb are sharp and can cause minor cuts to anyone or anything that touches it other than the attuned user.      |
| 9    | **Psychic**     | The orb becomes opaque with swirling and shifting colors that glows with a otherworldly purple across it's smooth surface.    | Causes simple images to appear on it's surface representing the thoughts of anyone that touches the orb.                         |
| 10   | **Slashing**    | The orb becomes opaque like metal and razor sharp edges appear around it's circumference.                                     | The blade-like edges of the orb can cut through objects with ease, leaving slit marks and scratches.                             |


- **Return Mechanism:** After the attack, the orb quickly returns to the user. If something stops it from moving, it teleports back to the user. If both movement and teleportation are prevented, the attunement is broken, and the orb falls to the floor.

- **Extended Range:** As a bonus action, the user can command the orb to move to a location within 30 feet. Spells cast using the orb as the focus can originate from either the orb's location or the caster's location.

## Charges:
*None*

## Curses:
*None*

## History:
Legend speaks of the Orb of Throwing being crafted by an ancient wizard who sought a versatile and powerful magical focus for both offense and spellcasting utility. The orb has passed through the hands of many spellcasters, each adding to its legacy of power and mystery.

## Additional:
Dungeon Masters should note the predefined elemental damage type for the orb upon attunement and ensure it remains consistent for the attuned spellcaster. The orb's movement and return mechanics can add strategic depth to encounters, encouraging creative use of its abilities.
