## History:
The Potion of Flos has a storied history, deeply intertwined with the tragic tale of its creator, a woman afflicted by a curse that gradually transformed her into a plant. Once a vibrant and lively individual, she found herself slowly succumbing to a mysterious affliction that turned her bones to wood, her blood to a verdant hue, and caused flowers to sprout within her.

As the curse tightened its grip, the woman's ability to communicate with creatures other than plants dwindled, leaving her isolated and despondent. Bedridden by her condition, she refused to surrender to despair. Drawing upon her dwindling strength and botanical knowledge, she crafted the Potion of Flos as a lifeline, a means to bridge the growing chasm between herself and the outside world.

With each delicate sip of the potion, she found solace in conversing with the verdant world around her, forging connections with the flora that surrounded her bed. The potion became her salvation, granting her moments of respite from her solitary existence and offering glimpses of the vibrant world beyond her confines.

Though her physical form eventually merged completely with the botanical realm, her legacy endured through the potion she had created. Passed down through generations, the Potion of Flos became a symbol of hope and communion with nature, its origins shrouded in the poignant tale of a woman who refused to be silenced by the encroaching tendrils of fate.
