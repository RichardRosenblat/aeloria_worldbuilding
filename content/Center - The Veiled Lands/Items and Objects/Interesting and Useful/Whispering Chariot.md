*"My liege, sire, oh allfather of speed, permit these lowly peasants to behold the swiftness of thy mighty chariot. Display unto them the very essence of haste, as they lament their inability to fathom such celestial velocity. Let no obstacle impede thy course nor obscure thy path until we claim the very horizon itself. For in the dust of our wake lies the testament of thy prowess, and in the echoes of our speed resounds the hymn of thy glory. Onward, I beseech thee, to the realms unknown, where the wind itself shall kneel in reverence to our passage, and time shall dare not linger in our wake. Oh, master of the reins, unleash the thunder of thy chariot and let the world marvel at thy boundless might!"*

**Name:** Whispering Chariot

**Description:**
A large chariot with space for 4 people, it is adorned with a golden shield featuring intricate details of wings, birds, skulls, and skeletons. The floor is crafted from ivory, and the wheels and yoke are made of dark varnished wood. Ghostly steeds appear at the yoke when activated, moving twice the speed of regular horses.

**Rarity:** Legendary

**Attunement:** Yes

**Properties:**
- **Ghostly Steeds:** When activated, ghostly steeds manifest at the yoke, propelling the chariot forward.
- **Whispering Skulls:** Randomly, the skulls on the shield's inner part activate, urging the driver to accelerate. If accepted, the chariot moves instantly one mile in a straight line.

**Activation:**
The chariot is activated by holding the reins and whipping them.

**Effects:**
- **Accelerated Movement:** Ghostly steeds allow the chariot to move twice the speed of regular horses.
- **Whispering Skulls' Offer:** Upon activation, the skulls may offer to move the chariot instantly one mile in a straight line. Accepting this offer results in uncontrollable acceleration.

**Curses:**
- **Reckless Acceleration:** Accepting the skulls' offer results in uncontrollable acceleration and potential damage to obstacles and creatures in the chariot's path.
- **Destructive Force:** Creatures or objects within the chariot's path suffer significant bludgeoning damage if they fail a Dexterity saving throw (DC 23 or 17 if more than 100 ft away). Any creature that fails the saving throw receives `dice: 10d10` of bludgeoning damage, with those driving the chariot receiving half of that damage. No one receives damage on a successful save. If there are any objects in the way, the check is considered an instantaneous failure. Any creature not killed by the chariot's speed is knocked prone, and any movable object not destroyed is launched 30ft into the nearest unoccupied space. Additionally, any immovable object not destroyed causes the chariot to launch into the air for a height proportional to the remaining travel distance before landing in its original destination, creating an arch in the air.

**History:**
The origins of the Whispering Chariot remain shrouded in mystery, lost to time. However, whispers among scholars and sages suggest that it was crafted in ancient times by a magic user obsessed with the concept of speed. This enigmatic figure delved deep into the arcane arts, harnessing mystical forces to forge a vehicle unlike any other. Legends speak of daring experiments and rituals conducted in pursuit of ultimate velocity. Despite the passage of millennia, the identity of the chariot's creator and the true extent of its powers remain veiled in shadow, waiting to be unveiled by intrepid adventurers bold enough to seek its secrets.

**Additional Notes:**
Use caution when accepting the skulls' offer, as the consequences can be catastrophic. The chariot's destructive force can alter landscapes and pose a danger to both its passengers and surroundings.
