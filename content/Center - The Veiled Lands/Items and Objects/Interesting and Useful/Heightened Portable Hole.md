# Heightened Portable Hole

## Description:
This finely woven black cloth surrounded by small golden details, soft as silk and folded to the size of a handkerchief, unfolds into a circular sheet 6 feet in diameter. When placed on or against a solid surface, it has the unique ability to either create an extradimensional storage space or transmute the surface to create a passage through it, depending on the thickness of the surface and user command.

## Rarity and Type:
*Very Rare, Wondrous Item*

## Requirements:
*None*

## Attunement:
*No (except for specific abilities)*

## Properties:
- **Almost Weightless:** No matter what is placed within the extradimensional space, the cloth remains almost weightless, and can be folded and carried with ease.

- **Extra-Dimensional Interaction:** Placing a portable hole inside an extradimensional space created by a bag of holding, Heward's handy haversack, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be reopene

- **Marking:** Once the cloth is used to create a passage and then removed and folded, it leaves extremely faint transmutation marks on the surface, detectable with a DC 20 Wisdom and it's origin determined with a DC 20 Investigation check. The use of a Detect Magic spell or similar can reveal these marks and their origins.

- **Ripping:** If the cloth is torn or ripped, it is destroyed and becomes a mundane piece of cloth, objects or creatures within the extradimensional space are ejected from the hole, appearing in the nearest unoccupied space to the hole's location. 

## Activation:
- The hole can be activated by using an action to unfold the cloth and place it on or against a solid surface. It can be deactivated by taking hold of the edges and folding it up, closing the hole or passageway.

## Effects:
- **Surface Transmutation Effect:** If the surface the hole is placed on is thinner than 10 feet, it creates a hole through the surface to the other side. When folded, any objects or creatures in the passageway are transported to the extradimensional space within the cloth. Any body parts or objects partially inside the hole when it's folded receive 18d10 force damage. If this damage reduces the creature or object to 0 hit points, it causes half damage and slices the body part or object at the area of the hole’s surface, leaving the sliced part inside the extradimensional space. If the damage does not bring the creature or object to 0 hit points, they can choose to be taken to either outside or inside the hole’s extradimensional space.

- **Extradimensional Storage Effect:**  The cylindrical space within the hole exists on a different demiplane, any creature inside an open portable hole can exit the hole by climbing out of it. Folding the cloth closes the hole, and any creatures or objects within remain in the extradimensional space. If the hole is folded up, a creature within the hole's extradimensional space can use an action to make a DC 10 Strength check. On a successful check, the creature forces its way out and appears within 5 feet of the portable hole or the creature carrying it. A breathing creature within a closed portable hole can survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time it begins to suffocate.

- **Attuned Control:** If the item is attuned, the user can use a command word to instantaneously switch between creating an extradimensional storage space or a passage through the surface.

## Charges:
*None*

## Curses:
*None*

## History:
This variant of the portable hole was created by a renowned transmutation wizard who sought a more versatile tool for exploration and infiltration. The wizard’s experimentation with spatial magic led to the development of this unique item, which quickly became a prized possession among adventurers and spies.

## Additional:
- Using this item in creative ways, such as in conjunction with other magical effects or traps, can yield unexpected results. The Dungeon Master should consider the implications of its usage carefully.
- This item is particularly useful for bypassing walls, barriers, and other obstacles without leaving obvious traces, making it invaluable for stealth operations.
