- **Description:** The Flow Sphere is a transparent glass orb with a series of concentric, rotating rings within it. Each ring is intricately inscribed with arcane symbols and emits a soft, pulsating glow.
- **Usage:** The Flow Sphere is designed to check the flow of magic in a given area. When activated, the rings within the sphere begin to rotate at varying speeds. The user can observe these rotating rings through the glass, and the sphere itself emits a soft, [[Ethereal Plane|ethereal]] light. The speed and direction of the rotating rings indicate the intensity and flow of magical currents in the vicinity. This unique device provides a visual representation of magical energy, aiding wizards and researchers in understanding the dynamics of the magical Weave.
- **Creator**: The Flow Sphere was created by [[Edali Urmal]]
