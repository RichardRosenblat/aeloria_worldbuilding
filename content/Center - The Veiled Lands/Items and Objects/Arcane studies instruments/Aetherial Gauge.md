- **Description:** The Aetherial Gauge is a cylindrical device crafted from enchanted glass and metal. It is etched with intricate sigils and features a central floating ring that hovers at different heights.
- **Usage:** When activated, the central ring responds to the intensity of magic in the area. The higher the ring hovers, the greater the magical presence. It allows researchers to gauge the intensity of the Weave and magical energies in a given location based on the ring's elevation.
- **Creator**: The Aetherial Gauge was created by [[Karsus Widogast]]
