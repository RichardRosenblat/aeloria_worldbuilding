Dear Gyda,

I hope this letter finds you well in the far lands beyond our mighty mountains. The halls of Brunhilde echo with tales of your adventures and as your brother i couldn't be more proud. The lands of the Pendragon really made you the adventurer you always wished to be. Maybe traversing the meridian expanse really was worth it!

I often find myself remembering our exploits as we kept sneaking out of class to paint the walls. Our home stands strong as always, the Sovereign of Stones once visited our little village. The empire is always seeking to take more miners into the capital. Stenklif keeps finding more and more riches in the mountains.
