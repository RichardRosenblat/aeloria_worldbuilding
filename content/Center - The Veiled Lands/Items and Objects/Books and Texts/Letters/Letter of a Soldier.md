*My love,*

*I know this dusty letter will not find you, but I hope I do soon, at a better place than this. With these eyes of mine, I have witnessed the end of time; Heavens were set ablaze; the bowels of the earth were frozen; fish drowned and clocks ran out of ticks.*

*It's been just a few days since the Cataclysm was unleashed. The screams of those souls still haunt me. The pillars were so bright all I could feel was dread. The fog burned everything and the water is undrinkable. The bunkers safe but the doors do not open. They sheltered me, but they cant treat me here.*

*I am sorry, dear, I think i won't return home. I am about to become a ghost and haunt these ruins. I'll be bound here, to this remnant of a past marked by flames, by hatred, anger and the misguided patriotism. Their joy is to see our bodies upon the streets.*

*All i wanted was a better life for us. But songs do not feel the same after what I've heard here. And all of the powers that could help us turned their back to us.*

*Now the melodies are different, nothing feels as it did before, we lost something really important with this war, and as i write this it seems like the memories try escape my memory.* 
*Clouds rain acid and fire, creatures beyond my nightmares soar over my head and things move on their own.*

*I know this is not normal, but i don't remember what is anymore.* 

*I keep dreaming of the shore, the sea is green and the green fog devoured our ships, only a few survivors remain in makeshift boats. But the storms keep bringing giants from the depths, they emerge in thunders, but they never move, just watch before rotting away with a lightning strike.*

*I yet don't know what it means. But i must go now, i struggle to keep my eyes open*

*Igo-*
