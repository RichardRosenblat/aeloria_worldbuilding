"The gods are real, they are divine and living beings that interact with the world and those who inhabit it through the veil beyond the [[Material plane]]. Their power is undeniable, and their existence proven time and time again through the powers given by them to their pious followers and their actions reflected upon the world. Neglecting their existence and their relationships with mortals that worship them as a source of knowledge that can allow us to understand the world, it's origins and nature, goes agains all of the progress we have made as a society, actively working against the betterment of the world and the people that inhabit it. The Divine Mythos is the result of such aknowledgement, a testament to the power of the divine in the Veiled Lands and their vastness of knowledge." - Excerpt from the introduction of the Divine Mythos

# The Divine Mythos

The Divine Mythos is a thick book, found in many temples, libraries and homes across the Veiled Lands. It can be found in many bindings, from simple leather adorned with simple designs and no illustrations, to ornate gold-leafed covers with intricate illustrations and illuminations. It's versions are as varied and widespread as the cultures that have adopted it, with each version tailored to better represent the names of deities specific to various cultures. The book is a comprehensive compilation of the divine myths and legends of the Veiled Lands, organized into a [[Mythical Timeline|cohesive timeline]] with aditional myths and stories that couldn't be placed in the [[Mythical Timeline|timeline]] at the end of the book.

## Origins of the book

*The Divine Mythos* is a monumental work of scholarship, compiled to represent the intricate tapestry of the Veiled Lands' divine history. It was first compiled by a group of scholars, priests and sages dedicated to preserving the myths and legends of the Veiled Lands. The book was first published by the Archivists at Camelot, in the year 465 of the Yggdrasil Era (YE)

## The Creation of the Divine Mythos' [[Mythical Timeline|Timeline]]

The base of the [[Mythical Timeline|timeline]] of the Divine Mythos was first compiled by the Archivists at Camelot. The [[Mythical Timeline|timeline]] was first assembled by the results of dozens of pilgrimages to sacred sites and temples of [[Ioun, Goddess of Knowledge - The Enlightened (N)|Ioun, The Enlightened goddess of knowledge]]. Drawing upon the knowledge stored in the temples' libraries and the memories of the priests and sages, some Archivists were also capable of communing with the goddess herself, who provided them with the knowledge of the divine myths and legends of the Veiled Lands. 

With the [[Mythical Timeline|timeline]] in place, the Archivists then began to compile the myths and legends of the Veiled Lands into a cohesive narrative. The myths were gathered from the oral traditions of the various cultures of the Veiled Lands, as well as from the written records of the temples from multiple [[true gods]] and [[over-deities]]. Each myth was carefully examined and cross-referenced with other myths to ensure that the [[Mythical Timeline|timeline]] was as accurate as possible. Any myths that were not able to be placed in the [[Mythical Timeline|timeline]] were placed at the end of the book, in a section titled "[[Untethered Myths]]".

## The Collective Nature of the Divine Mythos

The writing of the Divine Mythos was a collaborative effort, with many scholars contributing to the book under the banner of the Archivists. The patronage of the book was not limited to the Archivists, however, as the Pendragon Empire contributed financially to the book's research and publication. The aliance between the Archivists and the Pendragon Empire was a fruitful one, as not only the Empire's resources allowed the Archivists to travel to distant lands and gather myths and legends that would have otherwise been lost to time but also the Empire allowed the Archivists to publish the book under the Empire's name, which gave the book a wider distribution and greater acceptance among the people of the Veiled Lands.

## Cultural Adaptations of the Divine Mythos

The Divine Mythos was first written using the pantheon of the Alonian culture, the culture of the Pendragon Empire and by extension, the central culture of the Archivists. However, the Archivists were aware that the myths and legends of the Veiled Lands were not limited to the Alonian pantheon, and so they made an effort to create versions of the book that were tailored to better represent the names of deities specific to various cultures while maintaining the core narrative of the book. These adaptations were made by the Archivists themselves in colaboration with the priests and sages of the various cultures of the Veiled Lands, and were published in the years following the publication of the original book.

## The Divine Mythos influence on the Veiled Lands

As the book was extensively distributed and widely accepted by the people of the Veiled Lands, it became a cornerstone of the religious and cultural identity of the Veiled Lands. It can be found in temples, libraries and in the homes of the faithful across the Veiled Lands, and it is often used as a teaching tool by priests and sages to educate the faithful about the myths and legend of the Veiled Lands. The book has also inspired many works of art, literature and music, and it has been the subject of many scholarly debates and discussions. The Divine Mythos has become an integral part of the cultural heritage of the Veiled Lands, and it is considered by many to be one of the greatest works of scholarship, literature and a testament to the power of the divine in the Veiled Lands
