# Case Study Of The Wand Of Etherealness: Contradictions in the Timeline of Magical History
Research written by: Archmage Merlin of The Stars *et al.*
Date: 05 of Midsummer, 4th Era. (F.f.g: 10 years after King Arthur Pendragon coronation ceremony)

## Abstract:
During explorations of the Lowerdark, We unearthed a wand of etherealness that defies the established timeline of magical history. Through a series of rigorous analyses, including magical radiation dating and elemental divination, we have determined that the wand is approximately 12,000 years old, contradicting the gods' account of magical events. This case study presents our findings, methodologies, and implications for the understanding of magical history.

## Introduction:
I, Merlin of The Stars, Archmage and writer of this research, have been studying the history of magic for centuries. During my recent explorations of the Lowerdark, my companions and I discovered a wand of etherealness that challenges the established timeline of magical history. 
As stated by both the gods and temple records, the god Corellon Larethian, god of magic was reformed by the over-deities 11,000 years ago which resulted in the rewriting of magical laws and the destruction of all existing spells and magic items. This alone would have turned the subject of this research, the wand of etherealness, into a non-magical wand and through the ages it would have been eroded by time.
However, the wand is enchanted with the ability to cast the Etherealness spell (Arcanoglyph found in Appendix A) on the attuned person up to once a day and our dating methods have revealed that the wand predates the event of the reform by 1,000 years.
The wand was found floating in "The Void", a circular chasm located at the deepest city in the Underdark, Zenith, exactly 90,4 kilometers below the Lowerdark threshold beneath the Meridian Expanse Sea, 43 kilometers north of the Puntal Peninsula. 
The objective of this research is to present the means in which we analyzed the wand, the results of our findings, and the implications of this discrepancy on the understanding of magical history.

## Literature Review:
To provide context for our research, we reviewed existing knowledge on the age of the universe and magical history as provided by the gods. We also examined previous research on magical artifacts and dating techniques to ensure the validity of our methods. 
According to the records of the temples of Ioun, the goddess of knowledge and Corellon Larethian, the god of magic, the universe was created 1 billion years ago, in which the gods created all that we consider as reality, including the concept of magic, within 999.9 Million years. 
After this period, the second great event in the history of magic was during the event known as the Impact, which happened 20 Thousand years ago and lasted a quarter of a second, in which the Over-Deities assigned the true gods their domains and created the Divine Accord, this event is what assigned Corellon Larethian as the god of magic, entrusting him with the task of overseeing the weave
The Landscape of magic would not see any changes until the event known as the Reform, 11 thousand years ago lasting 3 days, this event was the response towards the ascention of the Raven Queen and Vecna into godhood. The reform caused the recalling of the gods to outside the Greater Limit, in which Aena and Kryela, the two over-deities, to rewrite the body of Corellon Larethian, changing the fundamental laws of magic, such drastic changes on the behaviour of the weave cause the destruction of any and all spells, enchantments, curses and magical effects.
Upon reviewing the literature, we defined that all magic items currently in existence must be no older than the first of the three days of the reform to comply with the gods' account of magical history. This is the basis for our research and the reason for the discrepancy we have encountered with the wand of etherealness.
As for the dating techniques, we have developed a series of methods to analyze the wand, including the identification of the spell, magical radiation dating, legend lore spell, Flow sphere reading, arcane spectrograms and ether dating. All these techniques have been previously tested and validated in controlled enviroments and in field. Research of the methods can be found in the library of Camelot, room 208, bookshelf 7, shelf 3, books 1 through 8 along with evidence of their validity. In more specific terms, these are the books which detail previous usage of the methods:

1. **Spell Identify**: *The Identification of Magical Properties*, by Merlin of The Stars.
2. **Magical Radiation Dating**: *The Decay of Magic and Properties of Arcane Origin*, by Archmage Merlin of The Stars.
3. **Legend Lore Spell**: *The Secrets of the Past: A look within the correlation beteween arcane consiousness and time*, by Archmage Merlin of The Stars.
4. **Flow sphere Reading**: *The Flow of The Weave and it's Constant Expansion*, by Edali Urmal
5. **Arcane Spectrograms**: *The Spectrum of Magic: The Space Between Magic and Mundane*, by Caelum of Brunhilde
6. **Ether Dating**: *Ether as An Instrument* by Luca Antares Di Campagna

## Methodology:
The wand of etherealness was subjected to a series of analyses using the methods described above. The following is a detailed description of the methods used to analyze the wand:

1. **Identify Spell (Arcanoglyph found in Appendix B)** 
   1. **Pilot Test**
      1. **Description:** The pilot test was conducted to determine the properties of a ring of invisibility created by Archmage Merlin of The Stars 5 years before the current research.
      2. **Procedure:** The spell was cast by Archmage Merlin of The Stars, as a ritual within his laboratory, he used a diamond sold by a merchant in Mjordal with the ring as target.
      3. **Results:** The spell revealed the ring's ability to turn the wearer invisible for along with anything they are wearing or carrying. The user remains invisible until the ring is removed, until the user attacks or casts spell, or until the user desires to become visible again.
   2. **Main Study**
      1. **Description:** The spell identify was cast on the wand to determine its magical properties. The arcanoglyph of the spell is provided in Appendix B. 
      3. **Procedure:** The spell was cast by Archmage Merlin of The Stars, as a ritual within his laboratory, he used a diamond sold by a merchant in Mjordal with the wand as target.
      4. **Results:** The spell revealed the wand's ability to cast the Etherealness spell on the attuned person once a day, with the effect lasting 10 minutes. The wand regains it's ability during dawn. And requires attunement to be used.

2. **Magical Radiation Dating**
   1. **Pilot test**
      1. **Description:** The pilot test was conducted to determine the age of the ring of invisibility created by Archmage Merlin of The Stars 5 years before the current research.
      2. **Procedure:** The wand was placed in a 2mX2mx2m lead-lined chamber, with a thickness of 5 centimeters in all walls, the radiation was then measured by leaving a crystal lens with a diameter of 30 centimeters and thickness of 2 centimeters in the chamber for 24 hours.
      3. **Results:** The crystal lens had become completely cloudy indicating high activity of magical radiation, when used as a spell focus, it caused a 1% chance of the spell causing psychic damage, indicating low energy magical radiation. Through this high-acitivity and low-energy radiation profile, the ring was, through the Magical Radiation Dating equation, determined to be 5 years old.
   2. **Main Study**
      1. **Description:** The wand was subjected to Magical Radiation Dating to determine its age.
      2. **Procedure-1:** The wand was placed in a 2mX2mx2m lead-lined chamber, with a thickness of 5 centimeters in all walls, the radiation was then measured by leaving a crystal lens with a diameter of 30 centimeters and thickness of 2 centimeters in the chamber for 24 hours.
      3. **Results-1:** The lens did not return any results, indicating that the wand did not emit any magical radiation within the 24-hour period.
      4. **Procedure-2 to 4:** The wand was placed again in the same chamber as procedure-1, the radiation was then measured by leaving a new crystal lens with a diameter of 30 centimeters and thickness of 2 centimeters in the chamber for increasing periods of time, from 
      24 to 96 hours (1 to 4 days).
      5. **Results-2 to 4:** The lens did not return any results, indicating that the wand did not emit any magical radiation within the any of the periods.
      6. **Procedure-5:** The wand was placed in the same chamber as procedure-1,  the radiation was then measured by leaving a new crystal lens with a diameter of 30 centimeters and thickness of 2 centimeters in the chamber for 120 hours ( days).
      7. **Results-5:** The lens returned with a single cloudy streak, crossing through it's center in a diagonal of 12Â° before leaving the lens, indicating a extremely low activity of magical radiation. When used as a spell focus, the lens caused all spells to gain ethereal qualities, showcasing extremely high energy magical radiation.  Through this low-acitivity and high-energy radiation profile, the wand was, through the Magical Radiation Dating equation, determined to be 12,000 years old. 

3. **Legend Lore Spell (Arcanoglyph found in Appendix C)**
   1. **Pilot Test**
      1. **Description:** The pilot test was conducted to gain insights into the history of the ring of invisibility created by Archmage Merlin of The Stars 5 years before the current research.
      2. **Procedure:** The spell was cast by Archmage Merlin of The Stars, he used incense bought at Mjordal, which the spell consumed, and four ivory strips bought at Mjordal.
      3. **Results:** The spell revealed the ring's creation by Archmage Merlin of The Stars, and the recent locations the ring has been.

Validation methods using elemental spirits of divination were employed to ensure the accuracy of our findings. The interviews with the elemental spirits can be found in the appendices.

## Findings:
The wand of etherealness discovered in the Lowerdark is a unique magical item, the following are the physical characteristics and magical properties of the wand:

**Physical Characteristics:**
- The wand is made of finely carved ivory, adorned with runes of an unknown language. (Copies of the runes are transcribed in dead magic paper and annexed in the end of the research paper).
- The handle is wrapped in parchment and leather, with a small cage at the tip of the rod containing a single glowing flame that seems impervious to touch or placement in water.

**Magical Properties:**
- The wand is capable of casting the Etherealness spell on the attuned person once a day, with the effect lasting 10 minutes. The wand regains its ability during dawn and requires attunement to be used.
- The wand emits a faint, irregular flow of magic, indicating its ancient and unstable nature.
- When using the wand, the user may experience inconsistencies in its magical properties, such as partial or failed activation. Around 10% of the time, the wand will not activate at all. Around 30% of the time, the wand will activate partially, causing the user to become ethereal for a shorter duration than intended.

So merlin studied a lot of topics related to magic
One of those topics was the actual age of the universe 
Dueing his explorations he found a magic item, older than any other, through his scientific and magical instruments he was able to date this magic item to 12 thousand years ago 
But such thing goes against what the gods, the ones mostly responsible with tellings us our distant past, say. According to many temples and Merlin's own contact with the gods that he compiled into a single timeline, the god of magic, corellon, was reformed by the over-deities 11 thousand years ago, such event is also known for destroying all existing spells and magic items that previously existed as the laws of magic were rewritten to avoid uncontrolled growth
When inquired the gods seemed to dismiss all evidence as impossible or some human error
So merlin concluded that either, the gods are lying (which he doubts since it goes against the nature of some gods) or the gods truly believe that to be true even if proven otherwise by evidence, or the item came from another dimension (which would hardly be the case since our current dimension is locked by a barrier made by the over deities)
The gods merlin personally contacted were corellon and ioun, the temples he researched were from each of the 20 true gods from within the veiled lands and two temples for each of the two over-deities
The item merlin encountered was an wand of etherealness, it seems to be made of finely carved ivory, adorned with runes of an unknown language (copies of the rune have been transcripted in dead magic paper and annexed in the end of the research) and wrapped in parchment and leather on the handle, a small cage at the tip of the rod seems to contain a single glowing flame that seems impervious to touch or placement in water. (Ilustrations of the wand are as follow added in between the pages)
The methods used were: spell identify (the arcanoglyph is in the annex of the research paper), magical radiation dating of the object and the location it was encountered, spell legend lore (arcanoglyph in annex), Flow sphere reading, arcane spectrograms, elemental distilation and ether dating, all these techniques (the ones that are not spells) were developed by merlin's crew of scholars and proved effective in previous studies found in his library inside the royal palace of Camelot, room 208, bookshelf 7, shelf 3, books 1 to 15. Elementals spirits of divination were also employed to validate the calibraton of mechanical instruments and validity of spells used, their interviews can be found at the end of the research paper.
The location the spell was found is in the void of the currently deepest city in the underdark, zenith, found more than 90 kilometers below the lowerdark threshold beneath the meridan expanse sea.
The item was capable of being attuned but its usage seemed to work partially or not at all at times, probably by its age and location it was encountered being saturated with magical power
