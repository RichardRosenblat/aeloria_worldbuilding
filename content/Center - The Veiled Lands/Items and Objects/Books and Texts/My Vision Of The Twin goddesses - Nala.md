When I first stepped into the ruins of the cathedral dedicated to [[Aena, goddess of kindness, creation and order - The Architect (LG)|Aena]], the air felt heavy with the weight of history. The stone walls, once majestic, now lay entwined with nature, vines cascading down like green waterfalls over the remnants of faded artistry. Sunlight streamed through the broken windows, casting golden streaks that danced across the floor, illuminating the dust motes floating in the air. The setting sun painted the horizon in hues of orange and purple, creating an ethereal atmosphere. With each step, I felt a deep reverence and sorrow. Even in its destruction, the cathedral still held a beauty that spoke to my soul.

As I reached the central space of the church, a brilliant beam of sunlight caught my eyes, and I instinctively closed them, the warmth radiating against my skin. When I opened them again, everything had changed. The crumbling stone was gone, replaced by the vibrant landscape of an island bathed in warm light. I stood atop a smooth stone building, surrounded by the sparkling blue of the ocean. The air was fresh and sweet, filled with blossoms I had never encountered. In that moment, a soft melody drifted to my ears—a song that resonated with an ache deep within me, evoking a longing for a childhood I had never known.

Drawn by the enchanting tune, I began to move. I followed the sound through open windows that framed breathtaking views of lush gardens and vibrant trees, their branches heavy with ripe fruits. The world felt alive, pulsing with energy, as if each blade of grass and each fluttering leaf rejoiced in existence. As I wandered, I reached an archway that opened into a sunlit courtyard at the heart of the island. There, two figures stood in serene harmony, their presence radiant and overwhelming. [[Aena, goddess of kindness, creation and order - The Architect (LG)|Aena]] and [[Kryela, goddess of malice, destruction and chaos - The Undoing (CE)|Kryela]], their forms unlike any depictions I had ever seen, radiated a profound nurture and love.

They sang to a group of children gathered at a fountain, their voices intertwining like threads of gold and silver. The children, laughing and carefree, were enjoying an array of fruits, their faces alight with joy. My heart swelled as I watched the exact replicas of the goddesses gently brushing the children’s hair, their delicate hands moving with care. Others cradled little ones in their laps, softly petting their heads, fostering an atmosphere of nurturing affection. An overwhelming sense of nostalgia washed over me, pulling at my heartstrings. Though I had never known this place, I felt inexplicably connected to the warmth and care that enveloped the scene. It was as if the longing I carried for a childhood spent in safety and joy was echoing back to me from a time long forgotten.

As I stood there, transfixed in the archway, the sound of the goddesses’ song wrapped around me like a comforting embrace. I realized I had stepped into a memory not my own, yet it felt as familiar as my own heartbeat. The light, the laughter, the love woven together in this Eden made me wish I could join them, to feel that sense of belonging and joy in my own life. I took a step closer, mesmerized by the sight before me. Amidst the laughter and the song, I felt the flicker of peace within me—a rare chance to stop and feel calm, just now, for a moment, all was well.

Suddenly, from the soft golden light, replicas of [[Over-Deities|the twin goddesses]] emerged, their ethereal forms shimmering in the warm hues. Their presence was enchanting, filling the air with a palpable warmth and tenderness. As they approached, I felt small, like a child standing before gentle mothers. [[Aena, goddess of kindness, creation and order - The Architect (LG)|Aena]], with her flowing hair that danced like sunlight, spoke first, her voice soft and melodic. “What brings you to this sacred place, dear child?” she asked, her eyes full of warmth. “You are far from your home.”

[[Kryela, goddess of malice, destruction and chaos - The Undoing (CE)|Kryela]], standing beside her sister, regarded me with a caring gaze. “What is it that you seek here?” she inquired, her tone both nurturing and firm.

My heart swelled with vulnerability as I met their knowing gazes. “I... I wish this was my home,” I confessed, my voice barely above a whisper. “This place feels so alive, filled with love. I’ve longed for a sense of belonging, for a place where joy reigns.”

[[Aena, goddess of kindness, creation and order - The Architect (LG)|Aena]] and [[Kryela, goddess of malice, destruction and chaos - The Undoing (CE)|Kryela]] exchanged knowing smiles, their expressions radiant with understanding. They reached out, their hands brushing against my face in a tender caress. “These were different times, dear one,” [[Aena, goddess of kindness, creation and order - The Architect (LG)|Aena]] said softly. “All things must change. But know this: soon you will find yourself in places different from this one, and that does not mean they will lack beauty or radiance.”

[[Kryela, goddess of malice, destruction and chaos - The Undoing (CE)|Kryela]] stepped closer, her gaze unwavering and proud. “You are strong,” she said. “A warrior and a free soul, unbound by chains as all spirits should be.” Her voice held a note of sternness, a reminder of the strength within me.

As they spoke, their joy and pride in me became evident. [[Aena, goddess of kindness, creation and order - The Architect (LG)|Aena]] smiled, her eyes sparkling. “You are beautiful, both in spirit and heart. I am proud to see you embracing your journey.”

Both replicas leaned in closer, their presence enveloping me in a warm embrace of reassurance. “This will be as it must,” [[Kryela, goddess of malice, destruction and chaos - The Undoing (CE)|Kryela]] assured me, her tone gentle but firm. “Trust in your path, for it will lead you where you are meant to be.”

I felt an overwhelming swell of emotion rise within me as their words sank in, their kindness and pride wrapping around me like a protective cloak. It was a moment I wished could last forever—a precious gift that stirred my spirit and ignited a flicker of hope within my heart. In that enchanted courtyard, surrounded by the goddesses, I realized that though I was far from home, I was not alone. Their warmth filled the space around me, infusing me with a sense of purpose and belonging that transcended time and place.
