# Arrow of Slaying:

_Weapon (arrow), rare_

This seemingly ordinary arrow carries a hidden power that can transform a foe into a vision of glamour and extravagance. Crafted by the illustrious magical drag queen bard, Paul Vittar, the Arrow of Slaying was born from her desire to combine her passions for showmanship and combat efficiency. 

**Appearance:** At first glance, the Arrow of Slaying appears as any other mundane arrow, with a sleek shaft and a razor-sharp tip. However, upon activation, its true nature is revealed as it shimmers with an ethereal glow, hinting at the transformative magic it holds within.

**Activation:** To unleash the magic within the Arrow of Slaying, one must speak the activation word, "Slay," before launching the arrow.

**Effect:** When the Arrow of Slaying strikes its intended target, it works its enchantment swiftly and with style. As the arrow pierces flesh, it simultaneously heals the wound it inflicts, leaving behind a trail of sparkling glitter. In an instant, the target finds themselves enveloped in a whirlwind of magical energy, their attire transformed into the epitome of drag queen glamour.

**Drag Queen Attire:** The transformation is nothing short of spectacular. The once fearsome adversary is now adorned in resplendent drag queen attire, complete with extravagant gowns, dazzling accessories, and impeccably styled hair that defies gravity. Their face is adorned with flawless makeup, expertly applied to accentuate their features, while their nails gleam with vibrant colors and intricate designs. Even their demeanor undergoes a dramatic shift, exuding confidence and charisma fit for the center stage.

**Mechanics:** Upon transformation, the target gains a temporary boon of newfound charm and grace, which may cause them to be momentarily distracted or disarmed by their own fabulousness. However, the effects of the Arrow of Slaying are not permanent, and the target will eventually revert to their original form once the enchantment wears off.
