# Bottle-o'-Party

**Description:**
The Bottle-o'-Party appears as a finely crafted glass bottle, adorned with colorful patterns and designs reminiscent of festive celebrations. It glimmers with enchantment, and its cork stopper is sealed with a magical insignia.

**Rarity:** Uncommon

**Attunement:** No

**Properties:**
- **Party Atmosphere:** When opened, the Bottle-o'-Party creates a sphere of magical darkness with flashing colored lights, confetti, and lively music, instantly transforming the surrounding area into a festive party scene.

**Activation:**
- The Bottle-o'-Party can be activated by simply uncorking it. Once opened, the magical effects ensue for a duration of six hours or until the bottle is recorked.

**Effects:**
Upon opening, the Bottle-o'-Party envelops an area of up to 30 feet in diameter with darkness and vibrant colors, shimmering lights, paper confetti, and joyful music. Creatures within this area are filled with a sense of merriment and euphoria, granting them advantage on Charisma-based ability checks and saving throws. Additionally, any creatures engaged in combat within the area must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (CD 10) or become distracted by the festivities, suffering disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the end of their next turn.

While the Bottle-o'-Party brings joy and excitement to those who experience its effects, prolonged exposure to its enchantment can lead to a sense of exhaustion and hangover once the effects wear off. Creatures who spend more than one hour within the party atmosphere must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion.

**History:**
Legend has it that the Bottle-o'-Party was created by a mischievous archmage known for his extravagant celebrations and love of revelry. Seeking to spread joy and merriment wherever he went, he crafted the bottle as a means to turn any dull gathering into an unforgettable party. Over the years, the Bottle-o'-Party has passed through the hands of various adventurers, bringing light and laughter to even the darkest of dungeons.

**Additional Notes:**
- The Bottle-o'-Party can be a valuable tool for distracting enemies or lightening the mood during tense negotiations.
- It is said that the enchantment within the bottle replenishes itself over time, allowing it to be reused indefinitely.
