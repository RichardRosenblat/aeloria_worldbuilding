Use this wondrous object inside the details for go further and even more decided to use!
you can really be far as decided as much to use and go wish for it!
when you decide far even wants to use and go want then get really far even as decided to use and look more like and go after.
it's just common sense!* - Inscriptions on the Thingmabop

## Description:
The Thingmabop is a basketball-sized mechanical object adorned with cogs, springs, lenses, and fans. Its appearance is intricate, with various bits and bops moving around accompanied by mechanical hisses and vapor valves. Despite its complexity, its true purpose and origin remain unknown. Across it's surface it has ancient runes with a enigmatic message.

## Rarity and Type:
*Rare - Wondrous Item*

## Requirements:
None

## Attunement:
No

## Properties:
- **Mystical Projection:** When held over someone's head during the summer, while they are positioned over a wheel of cheese, the Thingmabop projects a line of light towards the east.
- **Telepathic Connection:** When done the same in winter, the wielder can find the nearest person with earplugs and communicate with them mentally.
- **Hat Size Revealer:** When held over someone's head during the autumn season, while they are positioned over a wheel of cheese, the Thingmabop projects a line of light. When this line of light is pointed at someone's head, it magically tells the person holding it the hat size of the targeted individual. Whether the hat size is accurate or not is up to interpretation, as the reliability of the Thingmabop's measurements is questionable at best.
- **Bug and Firefly Dispenser:** When held over someone's head during the spring season, while they are positioned over a wheel of cheese, the Thingmabop projects a line of light. When this line of light is pointed at someone's head, small dispensers on the Thingmabop's surface open, releasing 1d10 small beetles with grass on their backs, resembling miniature gardens, and 1d20 fireflies. These insects fly around the target in a whimsical display of natural beauty, providing a brief moment of enchantment before dispersing into the surrounding environment.
- **Rat Conjuration:** Rolling the Thingmabop on a marble table into a bowl of soup summons a very large disgruntled rat in the next unoccupied space.
- **Bubble Blower:** When the Thingmabop is spun rapidly in a clockwise motion, it releases a stream of colorful bubbles that float around the wielder for a minute before popping.
- **Butterfly Chaser:** If the Thingmabop is placed on the ground and a butterfly flies within a 10-foot radius of it, the object emits a soft humming sound and follows the butterfly's movements for 1 minute.
- **Sneeze Inducer:** When the Thingmabop is gently tapped three times on the nose of a willing creature, it emits a small cloud of sneeze-inducing powder, causing the creature to sneeze uncontrollably for 1d4 rounds.
- **Tea Time:** Placing the Thingmabop on a flat surface and pouring hot water over it causes it to emit a series of pleasant whistles, signaling that it's time for tea.
- **Ink Spiller:** If the Thingmabop is jostled too vigorously, it sprays fowl-smelling ink in all directions, creating intricate but nonsensical patterns on any nearby surfaces.
- **Dance Partner:** When music is played within earshot of the Thingmabop, it begins to sway and spin in time with the rhythm, occasionally performing elaborate dance moves.
- **Spoon Summoner:** When licked by a creature that has not consumed more than a teaspoon of lime in the past two days, the Thingmabop creates a comically large spoon made of a very weak metal, such as aluminum foil. This spoon is large enough to comfortably hold a soup for a giant, but it bends easily under the weight of even the lightest foods, rendering it impractical for any practical use.

## Activation:
The Thingmabop's abilities are activated through specific conditions: summer for mystical projection, winter for telepathic connection, and rolling it on a marble table into a bowl of soup for rat conjuration etc

## Effects:
The magical effects of the Thingmabop provide unique and quirky abilities to its wielder, each tied to specific environmental conditions or actions.

## Charges:
The Thingmabop does not have limited uses or charges.

## Curses:
There are no curses associated with the Thingmabop.

## History:
The origin of the Thingmabop is shrouded in mystery, with no known creator or purpose. It has passed through the hands of various adventurers and collectors, each puzzled by its enigmatic nature.

## Additional:
Every long or short rest, a creature can make a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check to find out more about the Thingmabop. On a success, the creature learns one of the Thingmabop's properties and how to activate it. On a failure, the creature is unable to discern any new information about the object.

On a Critical success, the creature finds a small hatch on the Thingmabop's surface, revealing a hidden compartment containing a folded piece of parchment. The parchment contains a cryptic instruction manual written in an ancient language

### The manual:

Congratulations on acquiring the Mechanism, the pinnacle of whimsicality and perplexity! Below are instructions on how to operate this enigmatic contraption. Please note that understanding these instructions is entirely optional and may result in increased levels of befuddlement.

Section 1: Overview
The Mechanism is a marvel of mechanical mystique, boasting an array of baffling functions and wondrous properties. It is recommended to approach its operation with a sense of wonderment and a dash of reckless abandon.

Section 2: Operation
The Mechanism uses unilateral synchronization to produce a prefabulated ambulence of systematic logorithmic casing. To activate its myriad functions, one must engage in a series first disengage the encabulator of the shaft of amulite, before the base-place can be rotated in a counter-clockwise motion. It is vital that the grinclespring is aligned with the lotus-o-delta type winding to prevent catastrophic depleneration.

Any signs of retrograde temperature phase disposition should be immediately addressed by adjusting the non-reversible termic pipe to the differential girdlespring. Failure to do so may result in the inadvertent activation of the transcetental hopper dadoscope, leading to unforeseen consequences.

Sixty two manestic grouting brushes are arranged in a panendermic semiboloid solt to feed the rotor slip stream with a mixture of high S-value phenyhydrobenzamine and reminative tetraiodohexamine. The specific pericosities of these liquids are given by p=2.4 Cn, where n is the diathecial evolute of retrograde temperature phase disposition and C is the Chomondeley's annual grillage coefficient.

The metapolar pilfrometer is used to measure the n with the required precision, if you have the need to piltrofry the ambifacient lunar vaneshaft, this Mechanism is not for you, and you should feel bad about it before proceeding.

Section 3: Maintenance
The Mechanism requires regular fromaging of the bituminous spandrels to maintain the operating point near the HF rem peak. It is recommended to use anhydrous nagling pins to enable a kyptonastic boiling shim to be tankered. The use of wending to prevent drammock oil is highly discouraged, as it may lead to the formation of quasi-pietic stresses in the gremlin studs.

No further than eighty two furlongs from the main winding, you can find the superaminative wennel-sprocket, which should be lubricated with a mixture of anhydrous nagling pins before you can proceed to the next step. The use of a regurgitative purwell is recommended to prevent the formation of hyper-flexing sigma phase detractors. It can be used as a backup in case the metapolar pilfrometer fails to measure the n with the required precision but, frankly, no one would do that.

Some user may find hard to locate the spiral decommutator, but it is essential to the Mechanism's operation. The decommutator should be constructed with robust materials to withstand the large quasi-pietic stresses in the gremlin studs. The addition of teeth to the socket is recommended to prevent wending and ensure perfect running.

Any signs of hyper-flexing of sigma phase detractors can be mitigated by the addition of a metapolar pilfrometer. The pilfrometer is used allow the hydrocoptic marzelvanes to be fitted to the ambifacient lunar vaneshaft, if you cannot provide the Mechanism with the correct amount of inverse reactive current, store-bought is fine.

Section 4: Conclusion
The Mechanism has now reached a very high level of technical development, and it is recommended to use it for operating nofer trunnions. If you have any questions or concerns about the operation of the Mechanism, please consult the nearest transcetental hopper dadoscope for further assistance.

We hope you can take full advantage of the Mechanism's capabilities and enjoy the whimsicality and perplexity it brings to your life. Remember, the Mechanism is not just a tool; it is an experience. Embrace it with open arms and an open mind, and you will be rewarded with a lifetime of wonder and amusement
