## Rarity:
Rare

## Attunement:
No

## Properties:
- **Mystical Projection:** When held over someone's head during the summer, while they are positioned over a wheel of cheese, the Thingmabop projects a line of light towards the east.
- **Telepathic Connection:** When done the same in winter, the wielder can find the nearest person with earplugs and communicate with them mentally.
- **Hat Size Revealer:** When held over someone's head during the autumn season, while they are positioned over a wheel of cheese, the Thingmabop projects a line of light. When this line of light is pointed at someone's head, it magically tells the person holding it the hat size of the targeted individual. Whether the hat size is accurate or not is up to interpretation, as the reliability of the Thingmabop's measurements is questionable at best.
- **Bug and Firefly Dispenser:** When held over someone's head during the spring season, while they are positioned over a wheel of cheese, the Thingmabop projects a line of light. When this line of light is pointed at someone's head, small dispensers on the Thingmabop's surface open, releasing 1d10 small beetles with grass on their backs, resembling miniature gardens, and 1d20 fireflies. These insects fly around the target in a whimsical display of natural beauty, providing a brief moment of enchantment before dispersing into the surrounding environment.
- **Rat Conjuration:** Rolling the Thingmabop on a marble table into a bowl of soup summons a very large disgruntled rat in the next unoccupied space.
- **Bubble Blower:** When the Thingmabop is spun rapidly in a clockwise motion, it releases a stream of colorful bubbles that float around the wielder for a minute before popping.
- **Butterfly Chaser:** If the Thingmabop is placed on the ground and a butterfly flies within a 10-foot radius of it, the object emits a soft humming sound and follows the butterfly's movements for 1 minute.
- **Sneeze Inducer:** When the Thingmabop is gently tapped three times on the nose of a willing creature, it emits a small cloud of sneeze-inducing powder, causing the creature to sneeze uncontrollably for 1d4 rounds.
- **Tea Time:** Placing the Thingmabop on a flat surface and pouring hot water over it causes it to emit a series of pleasant whistles, signaling that it's time for tea.
- **Ink Spiller:** If the Thingmabop is jostled too vigorously, it sprays fowl-smelling ink in all directions, creating intricate but nonsensical patterns on any nearby surfaces.
- **Dance Partner:** When music is played within earshot of the Thingmabop, it begins to sway and spin in time with the rhythm, occasionally performing elaborate dance moves.
- **Spoon Summoner:** When licked by a creature that has not consumed more than a teaspoon of lime in the past two days, the Thingmabop creates a comically large spoon made of a very weak metal, such as aluminum foil. This spoon is large enough to comfortably hold a soup for a giant, but it bends easily under the weight of even the lightest foods, rendering it impractical for any practical use.
