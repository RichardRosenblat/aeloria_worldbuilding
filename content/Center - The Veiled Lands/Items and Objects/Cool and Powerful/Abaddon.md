# Cursed Item: Abaddon

**Description**: Abaddon is a malevolent demonic sword inspired in the shape of a chainsaw. The blade is adorned with small serrated teeth that seem to vibrate with dark energy. Embedded in the hilt is a sinister yellow eye that moves and watches frantically, as if possessed by an evil presence. When the hilt is activated, the teeth around the blade come to life, spinning rapidly, and the eye turns deep red, exuding an aura of malevolent power.
## Curses:
### Curse of the Damned Thinning:
When a character attunes to Abaddon, they become bound to the malevolent spirit residing within the blade. They gain enhanced combat abilities and strength when wielding the sword, but they begin to experience nightmares and haunting visions. These nightmares intensify over time, feeding on the fears and regrets of the bearer, slowly consuming their sanity.

### Curse of the Chainsaw's Embrace:
If the attuned user dies while in possession of Abaddon, the demonic spirit within the sword seizes the opportunity to escape into the dying body. It infuses the remains of the deceased, slowly reanimating the corpse with a cursed and unholy life. The former bearer, now revived, is affected by two new curses:
	1. **Tormented Vessel**: The mind and soul of the bearer become intertwined with Abaddon, eternally linked to the malevolent will of the sword. They lose control over the sword's wicked will, which begins to exert influence over their thoughts and actions, causing internal conflicts and chaos in their psyche.
	2. **Chainsaw Transformation**: While the cursed user embraces the powers of the Chainsaw Man, their appearance undergoes a grotesque transformation. Their body becomes muscular and imposing, with areas of metallic and irregular skin adorning their arms and torso. Bones protrude from their back, resembling mechanical chainsaw blades, and their face contorts into a terrifying visage, with sharp teeth and glowing red eyes. In this state, they gain superhuman strength, agility, and the ability to manifest chainsaw-like appendages from their arms.

## Additional Information:
Legend has it that Abaddon was forged in the deepest shadows of [[the Abyss]], a reaction to the harp of [[the Abyss]], created by a demonic being's weapon to spread destruction in the mortal realm. The sword's thirst for carnage and suffering fuels its cursed nature, and its insatiable hunger for souls keeps it perpetually bound to the world of the living.

The only hope for those who come into contact with Abaddon is to break the curse's hold by severing the bond between the demonic spirit and the blade. This can be achieved through a perilous quest, requiring the collection of rare artifacts and the performance of a powerful ritual at the exact moment of the sword's destruction. But be warned, such an endeavor is fraught with dangers, and even the most determined heroes can become ensnared by the malevolent allure of the cursed sword.
