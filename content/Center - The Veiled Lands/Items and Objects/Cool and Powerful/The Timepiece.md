**The Timepiece**

Command word: Tirakraxis

*Description:*
The Timepiece is a small and intricate item, resembling a gyroscope encased in a protective glass sphere. Within the gyroscope lies an arcane charm made of bone, serving as its focal point. In its dormant state, the gyroscope remains still, but when attuned, it comes to life, moving every second in various directions in a perpetual motion. The glass sphere is affixed to a delicate metallic chain.

*Physical Form:*
Surrounding the glass sphere, connected metal and wood pieces give the Timepiece an anatomical shape, designed to be easily held in hand. This additional structure enhances its usability, following the contours of the glass sphere.

*Notable Features:*
The body of the Timepiece contains a gauge with random notations. In its dormant state, the gauge remains static, but when attuned, it responds to areas where time overlaps, moving accordingly. At the top of the Timepiece are four dark glass lenses, similar to shards, capable of being extended and retracted.

*Activation:*
Upon attunement, the Timepiece comes to life. The gyroscope moves rapidly, the arcane charm glows, and a constant ticking sound fills the air. The user gains control over the lenses, which can be extended in areas of time overlap, allowing the user to peer through temporal distortions.

*Temporal Travel:*
By speaking a command word, the user can retract the lenses, initiating the Timepiece to transport the user, along with any touched creatures or objects, to the same place in the time overlap. Any alterations made to the past affect the future. The user can remain in the time-overlapped state for 5 minutes or until manually deactivated, expending a charge.

*Charges and Recharging:*
The Timepiece has a capacity of six charges. If the intended temporal destination is blocked, a charge is consumed without transport. If the user cannot return to their original time overlap, they remain stuck until the Timepiece recharges. After a long rest, the user can attempt to recharge the Timepiece by focusing on it, rolling a 1d6. On a roll of 1, the Timepiece recharges 1d4 charges. If the user is stuck, the Timepiece attempts to recharge automatically at the end of a long rest.
