# War Ring

## Description:
A ring made of dark metal, with an intricately carved design depicting twisted blades and weapons. At its center is a small, blood-red gem that seems to have a weak heartbeat. The ring feels cold to the touch.

## Rarity and Type:
*Very Rare, Wondrous Item (Ring)*

## Requirements:
None

## Attunement:
Yes

## Properties:
- **Transformation Touch:** When attuned, the wearer can transform any object or humanoid they touch into a weapon by speaking a command word. The transformation is irreversible, and the weapon takes on properties reflective of the original object (e.g., a sturdy tree branch might become a powerful sword with leaves on the hilt). After a given amount of uses the weapon will break and become unusable.
  
## Activation:
- The item is activated by speaking the object's name, the weapon the object will become, and the command word of the ring while touching an object or person that "Belongs" (in any way or sense of the word) to the wearer. The transformation is immediate and permanent.

## Effects:
- **Irreversible Transformation:** Once an object is transformed into a weapon, it cannot be returned to its original form.
- **Guilt Empowerment:** The weapon becomes more powerful based on the guilt of the wearer upon transforming the object or person. The DM should scale the weapon's power based on the level of guilt, with effects such as increased damage, enhanced magical properties, or additional abilities.
  - No Guilt: No bonus to attack and damage rolls, the weapon breaks after 1d4 uses.
  - Minor Guilt: +1 to attack and damage rolls. The weapon breaks after 1d8 uses.
  - Moderate Guilt: +2 to attack and damage rolls, and the weapon gains a minor magical property (e.g., glowing in the dark, minor elemental damage). The weapon breaks after 1d12 uses.
  - Severe Guilt: +3 to attack and damage rolls, and the weapon gains a significant magical property (e.g., major elemental damage, life-stealing properties). The weapon breaks after 1d20 uses.
  - Mind-Shattering Guilt: +4 to attack and damage rolls, and the weapon gains two significant magical properties. The weapon does not break.
  
## Charges:
- Unlimited use; the transformation ability does not expend charges.

## Curses:
- **Bound to the Ring:** Once attuned, the ring cannot be removed or unattuned by any means short of a Wish spell or divine intervention.
- **Intrusive Thoughts:** The wearer is plagued by intrusive thoughts of who or what they could transform next, causing them to imagine the weapon's power in every object they see. This does not affect the wearer's actions but can be distracting and unsettling.
- **Irreversible Transformation:** The wearer cannot reverse the transformation of any object or person they have touched with the ring, even if they later regret their actions.

## History:
The Ring of Irrevocable Transformation was created by a vengeful sorcerer who sought to punish those who would abuse power. The sorcerer imbued the ring with a curse that ensured its wearer would suffer greatly for using its power, amplifying their guilt and ultimately leading to their downfall. The ring has passed through many hands, each new owner leaving behind a trail of transformed objects and broken lives.

## Additional:
The DM should work with the player to determine the specific manifestations of the weapon's power based on the character's guilt. This can provide rich role-playing opportunities and allow for a dynamic and evolving experience with the item.
