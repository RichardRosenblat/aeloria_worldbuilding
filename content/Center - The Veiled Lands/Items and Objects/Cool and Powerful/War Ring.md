# War Ring

## Description:
A sinister-looking ring made of dark, tarnished silver, with an intricately carved design depicting twisted and interwoven vines. At its center is a small, blood-red gem that seems to pulse faintly with a malevolent energy. The ring feels cold to the touch and gives off an unsettling aura.

## Rarity and Type:
*Very Rare, Wondrous Item (Ring)*

## Requirements:
None

## Attunement:
Yes

## Properties:
- **Transformation Touch:** When attuned, the wearer can transform any object they touch into a weapon by speaking a command word. The transformation is irreversible, and the weapon takes on properties reflective of the original object (e.g., a sturdy tree branch might become a powerful quarterstaff).
  
## Activation:
- The item is activated by speaking a command word while touching an object. The transformation is immediate and permanent.

## Effects:
- **Irreversible Transformation:** Once an object is transformed into a weapon, it cannot be returned to its original form.
- **Guilt Empowerment:** The weapon becomes more powerful based on the guilt of the wearer. The DM should scale the weapon's power based on the level of guilt, with effects such as increased damage, enhanced magical properties, or additional abilities.
  - Minor Guilt: +1 to attack and damage rolls.
  - Moderate Guilt: +2 to attack and damage rolls, and the weapon gains a minor magical property (e.g., glowing in the dark, minor elemental damage).
  - Severe Guilt: +3 to attack and damage rolls, and the weapon gains a significant magical property (e.g., major elemental damage, life-stealing properties).
  
## Charges:
- Unlimited use; the transformation ability does not expend charges.

## Curses:
- **Bound to the Ring:** Once attuned, the ring cannot be removed or unattuned by any means short of a Wish spell or divine intervention.
- **Guilt Amplification:** The ring amplifies the wearer's feelings of guilt, making them more susceptible to mental and emotional manipulation. The wearer has disadvantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened.
- **Tormenting Visions:** The wearer is plagued by visions of those they have wronged or harmed, causing them to suffer from nightmares and restless sleep. This results in the wearer having disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks and suffering one level of exhaustion each day they remain attuned to the ring.

## History:
The Ring of Irrevocable Transformation was created by a vengeful sorcerer who sought to punish those who would abuse power. The sorcerer imbued the ring with a curse that ensured its wearer would suffer greatly for using its power, amplifying their guilt and ultimately leading to their downfall. The ring has passed through many hands, each new owner leaving behind a trail of transformed objects and broken lives.

## Additional:
The DM should work with the player to determine the specific manifestations of the weapon's power based on the character's guilt. This can provide rich role-playing opportunities and allow for a dynamic and evolving experience with the item.
