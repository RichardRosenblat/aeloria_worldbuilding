# The Ainulindalë: Song of the [[True Gods|Gods]]

The Ainulindalë, a sublime melody composed by [[Corellon, God of Magic and the Arts - The Spellfather (CG)|Corellon]], stands as the ethereal symphony that brought forth the fey species of [[Aeloria]]. Woven into the fabric of existence by the hands of the [[True Gods]], this celestial composition echoed through the [[metaphysical planes]], resonating with the elemental forces that shaped the world. Sung with purpose and intent, the Ainulindalë gave rise to the fey and elves, their creation infused with the harmonies and rhythms of the divine song. Each note and cadence encapsulated the essence of the [[True Gods]]' aspirations, creating a timeless anthem that reverberated through the ages, telling the story of the Ainulindalë—the sacred song that birthed life in [[Aeloria]].
