# Name: Makora's Scroll

## Description:
This ancient scroll is adorned with runes of chaos and destruction, its material is skin and bone. The scroll is said to be a gift from [[Gruumsh, God of Destruction - The Ruiner (CE)|Gruumsh]], the god of orcs, and contains the power to summon Makora, a fierce warrior blessed by the god himself. The scroll is a powerful artifact, but its use comes with a price. The summoning of Makora is a double-edged sword, as the warrior is uncontrollable and will attack friend and foe alike. The scroll is a dangerous weapon, and its use should be approached with caution.

*Legendary, Wondrous Item*

## Requirements:
No

## Attunement:
*No*

- **Summoning Makora:** When the scroll is read aloud, it summons Makora, a formidable warrior blessed by [[Gruumsh, God of Destruction - The Ruiner (CE)|Gruumsh]].

	*Rip and tear, may blood flow.*
	*No space to remain.*
	*Between blade and vein.*
	*Divine Champion General Makora, The unstoppable Butcher.*

## Effects:
- **Fire Rain**: While the scroll is being read, the skies darken and become red, and a rain of fire falls upon the area. The fire does not harm the summoner or their allies. but any creature within 120 feet of the summoner and not under cover takes 4d6 fire damage per round. The fire rain lasts for 1 minute, after which the rain stops but the skies remain dark and red for 1 hour, after which it will rain blood for 1 hour before returning to normal.
- **Summon Champion:** Upon activation, Makora appears at the nearest empty space and remains for 1 hour or until dismissed. Makora has all it's abilities and stats, and is not under the control of the summoner.
- **Rentless Attacker:** Makora will attack the nearest creature, friend or foe, and will not stop until it is destroyed or the duration ends, in which case it will return to it's previous location. If Makora decides or not to pursue the previous target is up to the DM.
- **Equipment and Halo of Curses:** Makora is equipped with any weapon or armor it had when it was summoned, their floating halo is surrounded with them.

## Charges:
*The scroll can be used once. After activation, it crumbles into dust.*

## Curses:
This scroll does not have any curse, just that Makora will attack the first creature it sees, and it will be summoned close to the summoner.

## History:
The Scroll of Makora's Summoning is a relic from ancient wars, imbued with the brutal essence of [[Gruumsh, God of Destruction - The Ruiner (CE)|Gruumsh]]. It has passed through the hands of many warlords, each using its power to wreak havoc and dominate their enemies.

### Scene idea
As your group stand victorious in the depths of the goblin-infested cave, a hushed silence settles over the chamber, broken only by the nervous shuffling of a lone goblin cowering in the corner. With trembling hands, the goblin reaches for a small item nestled within a torn and tattered purse lying forgotten on the cavern floor. Drawing forth a weathered scroll, the goblin's eyes widen with a mixture of fear and desperation as they begin to decipher the arcane text inscribed upon its surface. It gets up and starts to read the incantation aloud, their voice trembling with a mixture of fear and excitement.

"With this treasure I summon, the might," the goblin's voice quivers as they recite the words in broken Common, their words echoing ominously within the cavern's confines. At the entrance of the cave, the once bright sky begins to darken, as ominous storm clouds gather to obscure the sun, casting an eerie red hue over the entrance of the cave. 

"[[Gruumsh, God of Destruction - The Ruiner (CE)|Gruumsh]]'s fury, fiercest knight," the goblin continues, their voice barely a whisper now as the sunlight filters through the crimson veil, bathing the cavern in an otherworldly glow. As if in response to their incantation, the air seems to distort with energy, and the ground trembles beneath your' feet.

"Maul the weak, terror bestow, rip and tear, may blood flow," the goblin's words are lost amidst the roar of the encroaching storm, as burnign embers streak down from the darkened sky, a rain of fire forms around the entrance of the cave, scorching the earth and igniting the branches of the nearby trees.

"No space to remain, between blade and vein," the goblin's voice falters, drowned out by the howling winds that buffet the entrance of the cave. With a final, desperate cry, the goblin utters the last words of the incantation, their voice lost amidst the cacophony of the storm.

"Divine Champion General Makora, The unstoppable Butcher!" With a deafening burst of sound, the cavern is engulfed in a blinding flash of light, as if a bolt of lightning has struck the very heart of the chamber. You hear the splatter of blood as the light fades, and the initial roar of the storm is replaced the image of a massive figure standing behind the goblin, as if ripped from bowels of a enormous beast, it's appearance marked the surrounding area red with blood, gore and sinew. 

Standing before them, bathed in the glow of the fiery sky, looms Makora, a towering figure of primal might and unbridled fury. The goblin, now covered in fresh blood, sees the scroll crumble into dust, and slowly looks up to meet the gaze of the summoned warrior. With a single, swift motion, Makora snatches the hapless goblin in their massive hand raises them to their gaping maw, and devours the goblin's head in a single, brutal bite. As you gaze upon the formidable figure before you, you realize that the true terror has only just begun as Makora takes a step forward, their eyes fixed upon you with a predatory gleam.
