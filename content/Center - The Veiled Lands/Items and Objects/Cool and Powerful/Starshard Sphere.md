# Starshard Sphere

**Wondrous Item, Legendary (requires attunement)**

## Description
The Starshard Sphere is a golden orb about the size of an apple, adorned with intricate rings and celestial engravings on its surface. A small, crystalline lens allows one to peer inside, revealing a mesmerizing, swirling nebula of stardust and cosmic energy.

## Properties
- **Teleportation to a Demiplane:** Once per day, as an action, the attuned user can activate the Starshard Sphere. The user and up to 9 willing creatures within 10 feet are transported to a demiplane that manifests as a grand, floating fortress of marble and gold, suspended in a vast nebula.
  
- **Nebula Fortress:** This fortress resembles an opulent mansion with various rooms and amenities. The interior is illuminated by a soft, ethereal light. Amorphous servants made of stardust, called Wisps, attend to the needs of the residents. These wisps are non-combative, cannot be harmed or destroyed, and are bound to the fortress. They can perform simple tasks such as cleaning, cooking, and guiding visitors. Most of them can understand common, but only the chief wisp can speak it.

## Special Rooms and Features
1. **Observatory:**
   - This room is a vast, domed chamber with a circular glass ceiling offering a breathtaking view of the nebula outside.
   - In the center, a large, arcane telescope allows the user to see through the Starshard Sphere’s lens remotely, controlling its movement and hearing the sounds around the sphere’s physical location.

2. **Portal Doors:**
   - Several doors within the fortress lead to different parts of the structure.
   - A unique feature of these doors is that stepping through any of them can instantly transport the user back to an unoccupied space within 30 feet of where the Starshard Sphere is currently located in the [[Material Plane]].
   - **Dead Magic Zone Limitation:** If the Starshard Sphere is placed within an area where magic does not function (e.g., an antimagic field or a dead magic zone), the portal doors cease to function, and no spells can be cast within the fortress. Despite this, the fortress can still be moved along with the group inside, reappearing in the new location of the sphere when they exit.

## Activation and Usage
- **Attunement:** To attune to the Starshard Sphere, the user must spend a short rest meditating on the sphere while peering into its nebula.
- **Return:** The user can use an action to end the effect and return all creatures back to the point in the [[Material Plane]] from where they were originally transported. If the Starshard Sphere is moved while the party is within the fortress, they reappear within 30 feet of its new location.

## Lore
The Starshard Sphere is said to be a gift from a cosmic entity, designed to offer sanctuary and a vantage point from which to observe the cosmos. Its creation is shrouded in mystery, with whispers of ancient starforged magics and primordial [[Astronomical objects|nebulae]].

## GM Notes
- **Customizable Fortress:** The fortress can be tailored to fit the needs and style of your campaign, adding rooms, challenges, or treasures as desired.
- **Limited Use:** Consider imposing a limit on the duration of each visit to the demiplane, such as a maximum of 24 hours, to prevent abuse and maintain balance.
