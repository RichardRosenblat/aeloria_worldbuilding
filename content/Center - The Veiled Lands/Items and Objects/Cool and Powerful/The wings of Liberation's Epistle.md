# The Wings of Liberation's Epistle

## Description:
The Wings of Liberation's Epistle is a sacred scroll of significant importance within the lore of the [[Aeloria]]. Crafted by the divine hands of [[Ioun, Goddess of Knowledge - The Enlightened (N)|Ioun, goddess of Knowledge]], this ancient text holds immense power and profound implications for the kenku race.

## Creation:
[[Ioun, Goddess of Knowledge - The Enlightened (N)|Ioun, The Enlightened]], created the kenku race with a specific purpose in mind - to aid in the management of her extensive repository of knowledge. After the creation of [[Ioun's Archive]], the goddess wrote a epistle using a language that only the goddess herself could replicate. This sacred scroll, known as The Wings of Liberation's Epistle, was imbued with a powerful enchantment that would grant the kenku the ability to sprout wings and soar through the skies. This gift was betowed upon the kenku that accepted the task of managing the library, as a symbol of their newfound freedom and liberation.

## Storage:
The Wings of Liberation's Epistle was stored within a chamber deep within [[Ioun's Archive]], but never sealed away, for hiding knowledge deeply hurted the goddess' heart. Instead, it was placed on a pedestal in the center of the chamber, where it was bathed in the soft light of the goddess's divine presence. All those who were either able to find the chamber or were guided by the goddess herself were able to read the sacred text and receive the gift of flight. 

## Abilities:
Contained within the sacred pages of The Wings of Liberation's Epistle is a powerful enchantment bestowed by [[Ioun, Goddess of Knowledge - The Enlightened (N)|Ioun]] herself. This enchantment grants the ability for any creature who reads the scroll to sprout magnificent wings, enabling them to soar through the skies with grace and freedom. Many kenku who read the scroll were guided by the goddess herself to the chamber where the scroll was stored, and upon reading the text, they were filled with a sense of liberation and empowerment. The wings granted by the scroll were not only a physical manifestation of freedom but also a symbol of the kenku's connection to their divine patron.

## Important Information:
Although the Wings of Liberation's Epistle was created by [[Ioun, Goddess of Knowledge - The Enlightened (N)|Ioun]] for the kenku, any creature who reads the sacred text can receive the gift of flight. The scroll is written in a language that only the goddess herself can replicate, making it impossible for others to create a copy of the text or for it's contents to be transferred to another medium. It is also said that any being that achieves the gift of flight through the scroll is bound to the goddess and hears her whispers in their dreams with promises of knowledge and tales of the world.

## Loss:
Tragically, with the onset of the [[The Great War (GW)|Divine War]], [[Ioun's Archive]] faced devastation and destruction. Amidst the chaos and turmoil of battle, The Wings of Liberation's Epistle was lost as the library was consumed by flames and the knowledge contained within its walls was scattered to the winds. The whereabouts of the Epistle is unknown to this day. The loss of this sacred scroll represents a significant blow to the kenku race, depriving them of a tangible connection to their divine patron and the promise of newfound freedom. Yet, whispers of its existence persist, fueling the hopes and aspirations of kenku seeking to reclaim their lost heritage and soar once more through the skies.
