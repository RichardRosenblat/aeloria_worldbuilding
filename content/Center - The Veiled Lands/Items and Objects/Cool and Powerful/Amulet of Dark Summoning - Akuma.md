**Item Name:** Amulet of Dark Summoning

**Description:** The Amulet of Dark Summoning is an enigmatic magical artifact carved with sinister runes and adorned with shadowy stones. It emits an aura of darkness whenever it is activated.

**Effect:** When a player activates the Amulet of Dark Summoning, they can summon an Akuma to assist them in an imminent battle. The player must choose a specific target for the Akuma before activating it. The summoned Akuma will attack the designated target with dark ferocity.

**Consequence:** After the battle, the Akuma does not immediately disappear. Instead, it remains linked to the group for a short period of time. During this period, the group must be careful not to incite fear or hostility in the Akuma, as it is a volatile entity. The Game Master can create situations where players need to make moral choices or use diplomacy to keep the Akuma calm.

**Risk:** If the Akuma feels disrespected, feared, or provoked in any way after the battle, it may turn against the group as a threat. At this point, the Game Master can control the Akuma as a powerful enemy that now considers the players as targets.

**Restrictions:** The Amulet of Dark Summoning can only be used once. Furthermore, it can only be activated by a player willing to accept the responsibility of dealing with the consequences of summoning the Akuma.
