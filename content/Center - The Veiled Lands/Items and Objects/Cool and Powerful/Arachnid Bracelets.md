**Name**: Arachnid Bracelets

**Description**: The Arachnid Bracelets are a pair of intricately designed bracelets that appear as elegant accessories when deactivated. When activated, however, they transform into powerful tools reminiscent of a yo-yo with magical properties similar to that of a spider. The bracelets are made from a combination of durable and lightweight materials, adorned with delicate spiderweb patterns.

- **Abilities**:
    1. **Web Swing (Yo-yo Form):** When thrown with a swift motion, the Arachnid Bracelets create a strong and sticky web thread that connects the yo-yo to the user's wrist. This allows the user to swing across gaps, create improvised bridges, or immobilize enemies by wrapping them in webs.
    2. **Wall Climbing (Bracelet Form):** In bracelet form, they emit a subtle magical aura that allows the user to climb vertical surfaces, such as walls or ceilings, with ease. The user gains temporary grip, enabling them to move like a spider.
    3. **Web Attacks (Yo-yo Form)**: When spun rapidly, the Arachnid Bracelets can shoot small web spheres that temporarily restrain or blind opponents. These spheres can also be used to create a temporary shelter by weaving a web cocoon.
    4. **Acrobatic Maneuvers (Bracelet Form)**: The bracelets enhance the user's agility, granting exceptional acrobatic abilities. The user can perform impressive flips, spins, and aerial stunts with grace and precision, aiding both in offense and defense.
    5. **Disguised Appearance:** When not in use, the Arachnid Bracelets can transform back into elegant bracelets, concealing their true nature as a powerful adventure tool. This allows the user to blend seamlessly into non-adventurous environments.

Note: The web material created by the Arachnid Bracelets is limited in quantity and duration. It regenerates gradually over time, encouraging strategic and efficient use of webs during the game.
