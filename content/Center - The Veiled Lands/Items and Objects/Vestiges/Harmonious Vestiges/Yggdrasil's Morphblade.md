## History:
Yggdrasil's Morphblade was created by [[Melora, Goddess of the Wild and Sea - The Wildmother (N)|Melor, the Wildmothera]], from a branch of Yggdrasil, the World Tree. It was made to aid her chosen champions during [[The Great War (GW)|The Great War]], before being lost to time during [[The Impact (TI)|The Impact]]. It is said that it was last seen in the hands of the powerful archdruid [[Ivo of The Druids|Ivo]], who used it to inspire the druids of the world during the druidic revolution. After [[Ivo of The Druids|Ivo]] became Yggdrasil itself, it is believed that the Morhpblade became a branch of the World Tree, awaiting the next worthy wielder.

## Additional:
The Morphblade's dynamic nature and versatile forms make it a legendary weapon that can adapt to any situation. It is a symbol of [[Melora, Goddess of the Wild and Sea - The Wildmother (N)|the Wildmother]]'s power and a testament to the adaptability of nature itself.
