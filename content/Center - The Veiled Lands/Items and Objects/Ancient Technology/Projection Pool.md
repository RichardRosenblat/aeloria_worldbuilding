# [[Merlin of The Stars|Melin]]'s Projection Pools

[[Merlin of The Stars|Melin]], the legendary wizard, crafted a series of magical instruments known as the Projection Pools. These shallow pools, filled with enchanted golden sand, serve as powerful tools for communication and observation across great distances.

## Description

Each Arcane Pool of Sand is a shallow, intricately designed basin. The interior of the pool shimmers with enchanted golden sand that shimmer softly in the presence of light. At the center of the pool stands a pedestal, perfectly shaped to hold a roughly cut rune stone. 

### The Rune Stones

The rune stones are the key to the pools' magic. Each rune stone is unique, carved with ancient symbols and imbued with a connection to another Arcane Pool of Sand. The rune stones are made from various rare minerals, each resonating with a specific pool, allowing for a direct magical link between them.

## How It Works

When a rune stone is placed into the indentation on the pedestal of an Arcane Pool of Sand, the magic is activated. The golden sand begins to swirl and shift, forming a detailed projection of the surrounding area where the linked pool resides.

### Usage Example

1. **Person 1** stands before Pool A and places Rune Stone B on the pedestal.
2. The sand in Pool A starts to move, creating a detailed projection of the area around Pool B.
3. **Person 1** can now see the surroundings of Pool B as if they were there.

Simultaneously, in the location of Pool B:

1. **Person 2** stands before Pool B and sees the sand moving to create a projection.
2. The sand in Pool B forms a lifelike representation of **Person 1**.
3. **Person 2** can see **Person 1** in real-time, depicted in golden sand.

## Applications

The Projection Pools are invaluable for:

- **Long-distance communication:** Wizards and students can converse and observe each other without leaving their respective locations.
- **Exploration and discovery:** Adventurers and scholars can safely examine unknown territories by projecting the surroundings of distant pools.

## Conclusion

[[Merlin of The Stars|Melin]]'s Projection Pools are masterpieces of magical engineering, blending the beauty of enchanted artifacts with the practicality of powerful, long-distance communication and observation. Their existence showcases [[Merlin of The Stars|Melin]]'s unparalleled arcane prowess and continues to aid those who seek to explore and connect with the farthest reaches of their world.
