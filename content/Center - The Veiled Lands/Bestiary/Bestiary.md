# [[Aeloria]] Homebrew bestiary

Greetings, adventurers of [[Aeloria]]! In this page, I (your writer) would like to explain about this menagerie that is the Bestiary. It serves as a comprehensive guide to the myriad beings you may encounter on your journeys.

## Understanding the Statblocks

To enhance future gaming experiences, I present the creature statblocks in a readable and organized format. However, to maintain the immersive nature of [[Aeloria]] and for ease of integration into various platforms, the statblocks can be found in a code block format.

### Why Code Blocks?

I've chosen this method to make it simple for Dungeon Masters to utilize these statblocks. By utilizing platforms like Obsidian with the Fantasy Stablock plugin, you can easily transform these code blocks into proper statblocks for use in your campaigns.

Explore the Bestiary, and may your adventures in [[Aeloria]] be filled with excitement and discovery!

Happy hunting!

## Types of Creatures

In [[Aeloria]], creatures are divided into various categories based on their nature, origin, and abilities. These categories provide a framework for understanding the diverse inhabitants of the world and the roles they play within its ecosystems. The following are some of the primary creature types found in the Bestiary:

### Aberrations
Aberrations are entities that originate from planes of existence or dimensions that are profoundly different from the known natural world, such as [[Non-Realities]]. Their physiology and psychology often defy conventional understanding, exhibiting characteristics that are biologically and anatomically alien. Many possess intrinsic psionic capabilities, manipulating reality through mental prowess rather than traditional arcane or divine means. All aberrations share the single trait of generating diferent levels of meta-dynamic energy. Representative examples include aboleths, beholders, mind flayers, and slaadi, each exhibiting a range of exotic and often disturbing anatomical features and abilities.

### Beasts
Beasts are naturally occurring, nonhumanoid fauna within a given planet's ecosystem. They represent the biological diversity found in various habitats, including mundane species, extinct species such as dinosaurs, and exaggeratedly large versions of typical animals. While some exhibit limited magical traits, beasts generally operate based on instinct and lack complex societies or languages. They fulfill roles similar to those of animals in the real world, acting as predators, prey, or symbiotic participants within their environments.

### Celestials
Celestials are entities native to the [[Metapsychic Planes|Upper Planes]], often depicted as beings of immense moral virtue and divine origin. These organisms typically serve as agents or messengers of good aligned [[True Gods|deities]] or, in some cases, neutral aligned [[True Gods|deities]], embodying principles like goodness, law or justice. Their biology is often suffused with divine energy, granting them abilities that align with their righteous nature. Common examples include angels, couatls, and pegasi, each with distinct roles and characteristics that reflect their higher plane origins.

### Constructs
Constructs are artificially created entities, typically brought into existence through magical or mechanical means. They range from simple automatons programmed with basic instructions to highly intelligent beings capable of independent thought. Constructs are often composed of inanimate materials animated by magic, such as golems, or by mechanical means, such as modrons from [[Mechanus]]. Some constructs can even be made of living materials, like the flesh golems, but they are still considered constructs and not undead due to: instead of being reanimated by necromancy, being created from scratch using dead body parts with other arcane techniques and, when sentient, having a soul/identity of their own. Their existence blurs the line between the animate and inanimate, serving as laborers, guardians, or warriors depending on their creators' intent. 

### Dragons
Dragons are ancient, highly intelligent reptilian creatures with a profound connection to magic. True dragons, such as the good-aligned metallic dragons and evil-aligned chromatic dragons, possess significant magical abilities and an intricate understanding of arcane forces. Lesser draconic creatures, like wyverns and pseudodragons, share some physical characteristics with true dragons but lack their profound magical and intellectual capabilities. Dragons' evolutionary adaptations include immense physical strength, longevity, and often a breath weapon associated with elemental forces. True Dragons species all share the same basic anatomy, history of being created by the two draconic [[True Gods| gods]], [[Bahamut, God  of Justice and Nobility - The Platinum Dragon (LG)|Bahamut]] and Tiamat, and the ability to become stronger and more powerful as they age, gaining new abilities and powers as they grow.

### Elementals
Elementals are beings composed entirely or primarily of elemental substances and energies, originating from the [[elemental planes]]. These creatures can manifest as pure elemental forms, such as the classical elementals (air, earth, fire, water and so on), or as biologically structured entities infused with elemental power, like genies. Elementals play crucial roles in their native planes' ecosystems, often embodying fundamental natural forces and phenomena.

### Fey
Fey are inherently magical beings closely linked to nature and the ethereal realms, often residing in the [[Feywild]] or similar mystical environments. They exhibit a deep connection to natural cycles and magical energies, often appearing in forms that blend humanoid and natural features. Fey creatures, including dryads, pixies, and satyrs, embody the enchantment and unpredictability of their realms. All fey species share the same origin, either being born from the very first tree, or being created using its magic. The very first fey creatures were created by the [[True Gods|god]] [[Corellon, God of Magic and the Arts - The Spellfather (CG)|, Corellon, The Spellfather]]

### Fiends
Fiends are malevolent entities from the [[Metapsychic Planes|Lower Planes]], embodying pure evil and often serving evil aligned [[True Gods|deities]], some neutral aligned [[True Gods|deities]], or powerful infernal rulers. Their forms and abilities are as varied as their sinister roles their bodies are infused with corruptive energy. Fiends encompass a wide range of creatures, ranging from demonic beings like demons and devils to more obscure and specialized entities such as rakshasas and yugoloths. Fiends thrive in environments of corruption and malevolence, often seeking to spread their influence through terror and destruction.

### Giants
Giants are colossal humanoids with physical characteristics and cultures that reflect their immense stature. They include a variety of subtypes, each adapted to different environments and roles, such as hill giants, stone giants, frost giants, fire giants, cloud giants, and storm giants. These beings often live in isolated or tribal societies, exhibiting a range of behaviors from primitive and brutish to noble and sophisticated. The true giants species share the same origin, being the first conscious beings created by the [[True Gods]], [[Kord, God of Strength and Storms - The Stormlord (CN)|Kord, The Stormlord]] and Moradin, The Allhammer, and the ability to grow stronger and more powerful as they age, gaining new abilities and powers as they grow.

### Humanoids
Humanoids encompass a wide array of species with bipedal forms, advanced cognitive abilities, and complex societies. This category includes humans, elves, dwarves, and other races commonly found in player characters, as well as more savage and barbaric species like orcs, goblinoids, and gnolls. Humanoids exhibit a vast spectrum of cultures, languages, and magical characteristics or aptudes, often playing central roles in the socio-political landscapes of [[Aeloria]]. They are the most common and diverse creature type in the world, reflecting the rich tapestry of sentient life.

### Monstrosities
Monstrosities are aberrant creatures that defy natural classification, often resulting from magical experimentation or supernatural curses. These entities can possess bizarre and horrifying forms and abilities, making them unpredictable threats. Examples include the owlbear, a hybrid creature resulting from magical tampering, and the yuan-ti, humanoid-serpent hybrids born of dark rituals. Monstrosities represent the chaotic and often dangerous intersection of uncontrolled magic and biology. All monstrosities share the concentrated magical energy in their bodies, which can be seen once their dead bodies are decomposed, as the process releases said energy transforming the area around it in varying degrees, returning the energy to the environment to be used again by the weave.

### Oozes
Oozes are amorphous, gelatinous organisms primarily inhabiting subterranean environments. They consume organic material through a process of absorption, often digesting their prey externally before absorbing the nutrients. Examples include black puddings and gelatinous cubes, which exhibit remarkable adaptability to their environments and resilience against various threats. The origin of oozes is still debated, with some scholars suggesting they are the result of magical contamination or alchemical experiments gone awry or the creation of a [[True God]] or demon lord, more specifically, Juiblex, the Faceless Lord, who is known for creating and controlling oozes.

### Plants
Plants are living organisms that most often derive energy through photosynthesis, often exhibiting unique adaptations and abilities. In [[Aeloria]], plants can range from mundane flora to sentient, mobile species capable of communication and complex behaviors. Some plant creatures, like treants and shambling mounds, possess rudimentary intelligence and the ability to move and interact with their environments. Plants play essential roles in the world's ecosystems, providing food, shelter, and resources for other creatures. In [[Aeloria]], the category of plants also includes fungi, lichens, and other non-animal life forms that share characteristics with traditional plants, even if unlike traditional plants, obtain energy through the decomposition of organic matter

### Undead
Undead are once-living beings reanimated through necromantic magic or cursed to a state of undeath. They span a range of forms, from corporeal entities like vampires and zombies to incorporeal spirits such as ghosts and specters. Undead often retain fragments of their former selves, driven by insatiable hungers or unfulfilled purposes, making them both tragic and terrifying figures within [[Aeloria]].
