# [[Aeloria]] Homebrew bestiary

Greetings, adventurers of [[Aeloria]]! In this page, I (your writer) would like to explain about this menagerie that is the Bestiary. It serves as a comprehensive guide to the myriad beings you may encounter on your journeys.

## Understanding the Statblocks

To enhance your gaming experience, I present the creature statblocks in a readable and organized format. However, to maintain the immersive nature of [[Aeloria]] and for ease of integration into various platforms, the statblocks can be found in a code block format.

```

```

### Why Code Blocks?

I've chosen this method to make it simple for Dungeon Masters to utilize these statblocks. By utilizing platforms like Obsidian with the Fantasy Stablock plugin, you can easily transform these code blocks into proper statblocks for use in your campaigns.

Explore the Bestiary, and may your adventures in [[Aeloria]] be filled with excitement and discovery!

Happy questing!
