## The Myth:

**Winter (Raven Queen's Ritual):**

During the year, the Raven Queen gathers the souls of the deceased from various afterlives across the cosmos—be they fallen demon souls from the Abyss or the soul of angels killed in Mount Celestia. These souls, having met their final death, are collected in her cloak, staying hidden beneath it. As the winter solstice approaches, the Raven Queen spreads her shadowed wings wide, and the souls, now darkened and cold, begin their march through the astral plane towards the Greater Limit—a barrier that protects reality, keeping it safe on its inner side from the non-realities that reside beyond it, such as the realm of the Over-deities.

Upon reaching the Greater Limit, the souls pass through the veil as if it were a thin mist, with the Raven Queen staying behind. The souls cross over to the other side, where Kryela, the over-deity of destruction and chaos, awaits. Kryela, with her frigid presence and destructive nature near the Greater Limit, absorbs these souls into true oblivion. The sheer coldness of Kryela's power and her proximity to the Greater Limit cause a profound chill to descend upon the mortal world, marking the onset of winter.

**Spring (Corellon's Ritual):**

Throughout the year, Corellon, god of Magic and Creativity, traverses the astral plane, collecting lost dreams, unfulfilled ideas, unrealized desires, and forgotten inspirations. These fragments of creativity, abandoned in the minds of living, unliving, and souls who have met their final death before being taken to oblivion during winter, are carefully gathered and stored within his divine essence. As the spring equinox approaches, Corellon prepares for a grand ritual. On the day of the equinox, he releases these collected fragments in a magnificent and intricate spell overflowing with raw magical power and creative energy that guides the ideas and inspirations into different minds across the realms.

This wave of energy spreads throughout the cosmos, sneaking the ideas and inspirations into the minds of all beings, sparking new thoughts, epiphanies, and inspiring visions. Artists, inventors, and thinkers across the realms find themselves filled with brilliant ideas and a renewed sense of purpose, as these fragments of creativity take root and sooner or later blossom into new works of art, inventions, and innovations.

Aena, the over-deity of Creation and Order, is deeply moved by this spectacle. Her heart fills with joy at the sight of so much creative potential being realized. Drawn by the beauty of Corellon's act, Aena moves closer to the edges of the Greater Limit, her radiant presence illuminating the boundary between reality and the beyond. As she smiles upon reality, her nurturing energy causes flowers, plants, and trees to burst into bloom. The world is awash with vibrant colors and the scent of fresh blossoms, marking the arrival of spring. This season of growth and renewal is a testament to the power of creativity and the eternal cycle of life.

**Summer (Pelor's Ritual):**

In contrast to Kryela's devouring coldness during winter, the summer solstice brings forth a different ritual, one equally significant in its own right. During the year, Aena, the over-deity of Creation and Order, crafts and sculpts new souls from her burning love and creative essence. These souls, radiant and burning with white-hot energy, are nurtured by Aena until the summer solstice arrives. At this pivotal moment, Aena gathers these newly formed souls and guides them towards the outer edge of the Greater Limit.

At the Greater Limit's edge, Aena gently releases the souls, guiding them into the barrier, where they are bathed in her warm light before passing through the veil as if it were a shimmering wall of water. On the other side of the Greater Limit—the inner side, where reality resides—Pelor, the god of the sun and light, stands ready to receive the souls created by his mother. With Pelor's guidance, using his light as a torch and beacon, the souls traverse the astral plane, following the path illuminated by his divine radiance.

Once guided by Pelor's light, the souls are brought into the heart of the astral plane, where they await their next journey, being incarnated into bodies within one of the many planes of existence. Aena's intense presence and the heat of her burning love, even from beyond the Greater Limit, cause the mortal world to be bathed in the warmth of summer, marking the season of warmth, work, and growth.

**Fall (Avandra's Ritual):**

Throughout the year, Avandra, goddess of Luck and Change, compiles a list of souls that seem to either need change in their lives or have grown accustomed to monotony. This list is made according to her own unpredictable whims, capturing the essence of those she deems worthy of experiencing the thrill of change. As the fall equinox approaches, Avandra meticulously prepares a series of events, a mix of fortunate and unfortunate occurrences designed to disrupt the status quo in the lives of those on her list.

On the day of the equinox, Avandra, with a single flick of her finger, triggers these events. This sudden cascade of luck and misfortune spreads across the realms, touching the lives of many. Some experience unexpected windfalls, while others face unforeseen challenges. These events, unpredictable and chaotic, bring about significant changes, forcing individuals to adapt and grow.

Kryela, the over-deity of Destruction and Chaos, becomes enthralled by the disruptive nature of Avandra's actions. Intrigued by the unfolding chaos, she inches closer to the Greater Limit, watching with keen interest as the events set in motion by Avandra play out. Her proximity to the barrier between reality and the beyond causes a chill to descend upon the world. Leaves begin to wither and die, falling from trees in a cascade of red, gold, and brown. The air grows cooler, and the landscape transforms, marking the onset of fall.

This season of change and decay reflects the natural cycle of life, reminding all beings of the inevitability of transformation and the beauty that can arise from disruption. Avandra's influence, coupled with Kryela's chilling presence, heralds the arrival of autumn, a time for reflection, adaptation, and preparation for the winter to come.

**Belief in the Reincarnation Cycle:** 

Across various cultures and civilizations, belief in the cycle of reincarnation is deeply rooted. They believe that souls, behind the Greater Limit, move cyclically between Aena and Kryela, perpetuating the eternal balance of creation and destruction. Souls are thought to undergo a transformative journey, transitioning from oblivion under Kryela's care to rebirth and renewal under Aena's nurturing gaze. This belief fosters a profound reverence for the natural order and the interconnectedness of life and death. It inspires rituals and ceremonies during solstices, where communities gather to honor their ancestors and offer prayers for the souls traveling between realms. Each reincarnation is seen as an opportunity for spiritual growth and enlightenment, with the guidance of the gods shaping the destinies of mortals in accordance with cosmic harmony. Thus, the cycle of reincarnation becomes not just a theological concept, but a fundamental aspect of cultural identity and spiritual practice, weaving together the tapestry of existence across the realms of gods and mortals alike. The inhabitants' respect for the natural cycles of the seasons is intertwined with their belief in reincarnation, seeing each season as a reflection of the soul's journey through the cycles of life, death, and rebirth.
