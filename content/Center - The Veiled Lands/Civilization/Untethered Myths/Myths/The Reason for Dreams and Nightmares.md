## The Myth:

![[The Creation (CR)#The Creation of Dreams and Nightmares]]

To this day, mortals carry on the legacy of this divine conflict. It is said that after one awakes, the illusions of [[Sehanine, Goddess of the Moon, Dreams and Tricks - The Moonweaver (CG)|Sehanine]] and the terrors of [[Tharizdun, God of Entropy and Madness - The Chained Oblivion (CE)|Tharizdun]] retreat to the pillow, hiding in opposite sides. So it is believed that the side of the pillow upon which one rests influences which creation gains advantage in the eternal struggle. When plagued by nightmares, mortals flip their pillows, hoping to tilt the balance towards [[Sehanine, Goddess of the Moon, Dreams and Tricks - The Moonweaver (CG)|Sehanine]]'s gentle dreams.

Thus, the realm of dreams remains a realm of unpredictable fascination, shaped by the ongoing war between [[Sehanine, Goddess of the Moon, Dreams and Tricks - The Moonweaver (CG)|Sehanine]], [[Sehanine, Goddess of the Moon, Dreams and Tricks - The Moonweaver (CG)|the Moonweaver]], and [[Tharizdun, God of Entropy and Madness - The Chained Oblivion (CE)|Tharizdun]], [[Tharizdun, God of Entropy and Madness - The Chained Oblivion (CE)|the Chained Oblivion]].
