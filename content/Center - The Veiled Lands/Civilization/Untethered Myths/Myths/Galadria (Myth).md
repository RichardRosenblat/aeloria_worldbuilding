## The Myth:

According to ancient tales, the elven woman Galadria was renowned for her beauty and grace, the beloved daughter of a powerful noble sorcerer. In her youth, Galadria fell deeply in love with an outlaw, a man of charm and fierce independence. Despite their vastly different worlds, they believed they were destined to be together.

Galadria's father vehemently opposed their union, perceiving the outlaw as a threat to their family's honor and future. Defying her father's wishes, Galadria and her lover decided to run away together. They agreed to meet at the shore of a nearby lake, under the cover of night, to begin their new life.

To finance their escape, Galadria took part of her father's money and jewels. With a heavy heart but unwavering resolve, she made her way to the meeting place. However, what awaited her was a cruel betrayal. The outlaw, in league with his band of thieves, had laid a trap. As soon as Galadria arrived, they ambushed her, stealing the money and jewels. The outlaw himself dealt the fatal blow, killing Galadria without a second thought.

Her father, who had secretly followed her to the lake, arrived too late. Finding his daughter's lifeless body, he wept bitterly. In his desperation, he invoked the name of [[Sehanine, Goddess of the Moon, Dreams and Tricks - The Moonweaver (CG)|Sehanine Ithilgalad]], the [[Sehanine, Goddess of the Moon, Dreams and Tricks - The Moonweaver (CG)|The Silver Lady]] and goddess of the [[The Moon (Aeloria's)|moon]], pleading for her to bring Galadria back to life.

[[Sehanine, Goddess of the Moon, Dreams and Tricks - The Moonweaver (CG)|Sehanine]], moved by the father's profound grief and Galadria's tragic fate, appeared to him in the reflection of the lake. She expressed her desire to grant his wish but explained that the afterlife required a soul to maintain its balance. The father, without hesitation, offered his own soul in place of his daughter's.

[[Sehanine, Goddess of the Moon, Dreams and Tricks - The Moonweaver (CG)|Sehanine]] acknowledged that such an exchange could grant Galadria a new life. However, she warned that the great power of a goddess would mark Galadria, transforming her forever. The father, driven by his love for his daughter, accepted the terms.

With the full moon reflected on the surface of the lake, the father gently submerged Galadria's body in the water. As he did, the divine contract took effect. The water shimmered with celestial light, and Galadria was resurrected, her appearance transformed. Her skin turned pale as moonlight, her hair white as snow, her eyes now glowed with a gentle, lunar radiance and the shadows of her body were as dark as the night.

Galadria awoke to a new life, her father's sacrifice filling her with a profound sense of purpose and devotion. She became a worshiper of [[Sehanine, Goddess of the Moon, Dreams and Tricks - The Moonweaver (CG)|Sehanine]], dedicating herself to the [[The Moon (Aeloria's)|moon]] goddess. Her father, true to his word, was taken to the [[The Moon (Aeloria's)|moon]], becoming a celestial being and protector of the celestial body, watching over his daughter from the heavens.

The outlaw, cursed by the father's final act, was transformed into the first werewolf, a creature of darkness and ferocity. Consumed by vengeance, he relentlessly hunted Galadria, but [[Sehanine, Goddess of the Moon, Dreams and Tricks - The Moonweaver (CG)|Sehanine]]'s divine protection always shielded her.

Many years passed, and the outlaw, driven by his insatiable desire for revenge, plotted a final trap. On a night when the [[The Moon (Aeloria's)|moon]] was hidden and [[Sehanine, Goddess of the Moon, Dreams and Tricks - The Moonweaver (CG)|Sehanine]]'s protective gaze was veiled, he captured Galadria, imprisoning her in a fortified stronghold. In her darkest hour, Galadria prayed fervently to [[Sehanine, Goddess of the Moon, Dreams and Tricks - The Moonweaver (CG)|Sehanine]], striking a sacred bargain. She agreed to become [[Sehanine, Goddess of the Moon, Dreams and Tricks - The Moonweaver (CG)|Sehanine]]'s champion in exchange for her freedom.

[[Sehanine, Goddess of the Moon, Dreams and Tricks - The Moonweaver (CG)|Sehanine]] accepted, infusing Galadria with the [[Sehanine, Goddess of the Moon, Dreams and Tricks - The Moonweaver (CG)|The Silver Lady]]'s power. Empowered by celestial magic, Galadria could now call upon the vestiges of the [[The Moon (Aeloria's)|moon]], wielding items crafted by the goddess herself. With her newfound strength, she escaped the stronghold and confronted the outlaw. In a fierce battle, she finally slew him, ending his reign of terror forever.

As a reward for her unwavering faith and bravery, [[Sehanine, Goddess of the Moon, Dreams and Tricks - The Moonweaver (CG)|Sehanine]] granted Galadria a celestial sanctuaryâ€”a home in the skies above, where she could wander freely in a world untouched by darkness. There, she continues to serve as the [[Sehanine, Goddess of the Moon, Dreams and Tricks - The Moonweaver (CG)|The Silver Lady]]'s champion, a beacon of light and hope, forever protected and cherished by the goddess she serves.
