The myth of the tieflings is known throughout the Veiled Lands, with variations in the details and interpretations of the tale. Some cultures view tieflings with fear and suspicion, believing them to be cursed and bearing the mark of their infernal ancestry. Others see tieflings as tragic figures, caught between two worlds and struggling to find their place in a society that shuns them. Despite these differences, the core of the myth remains consistent across the Veiled Lands, serving as a cautionary tale of the dangers of making deals with dark powers.

Other changes also include the changing of the name of [[Asmodeus, God of Tyranny - The Lord of the Nine Hells (LE)|the Lord of the Nine Hells]], with some cultures referring to him as [[Asmodeus, God of Tyranny - The Lord of the Nine Hells (LE)|Asmodeus]], while others use different names and titles to describe the infernal entity.

## The Myth:
  
In the recods of [[Aeloria]]'s history, there exists a myth shrouded in darkness, whispered in hushed tones around flickering hearth fires. Long ago, a mortal, consumed by ambition and blinded by his own desires, dared to strike a bargain with the dread Lord of [[the Nine Hells]], [[Asmodeus, God of Tyranny - The Lord of the Nine Hells (LE)|Asmodeus]] himself. In exchange for power beyond mortal reckoning, he pledged his allegiance and the souls of his descendants for eternity. Little did he know the true cost of his folly. As the ink dried upon the infernal contract, his bloodline was forever cursed, destined to bear the mark of the tiefling. From that cursed pact sprang forth the first tieflings, bearing the infernal taint of their diabolical ancestry.

Through the ages, whispers spread of alternative methods by which tiefling children came into existence. Some mortals, by sheer accident or ill-fated curiosity, found themselves touched by the arcane energies of the [[Metapsychic Planes|lower planes]], forever altering their lineage. Others, driven by reckless desire or unholy temptation, succumbed to unions with beings from the depths of the [[Metapsychic Planes|lower planes]], birthing offspring marked by both mortal and infernal blood. Thus, alongside those born of infernal pacts, tieflings roamed the realms of [[Aeloria]], a reminder of mortals' perilous dance with the powers beyond and the eternal consequences that follow.
