## Origins

Harrowsnight traces its roots back to ancient beliefs, where the 30th night of [[Months|Leafturn]] was deemed significant. According to [[Aeloria|Aelorian]] lore, on this night, [[Kryela, goddess of malice, destruction and chaos - The Undoing (CE)|Kryela]]'s gaze reaches its peak intensity, thinning the veil between the [[Shadowfell]] and the [[Material Plane]].

## Purpose of Celebration

The primary purpose of Harrowsnight is to safeguard the souls of the departed from [[Kryela, goddess of malice, destruction and chaos - The Undoing (CE)|Kryela]]'s malevolent gaze. The thinning of the boundaries between planes during this night also allows creatures to traverse between the [[material plane]] and the [[Shadowfell]]. The celebrations are designed to create an atmosphere resembling the [[Shadowfell]], making it easier for dark creatures to return to their realm without unsettling the inhabitants of the [[material plane]].

## Means of Celebrating

- **Trick-or-Treating:** An integral part of the celebration involves individuals, especially children, going door-to-door, collecting candy and treats. This tradition is seen as a way to appease [[Kryela, goddess of malice, destruction and chaos - The Undoing (CE)|Kryela]] and safeguard the souls of the living from her watchful gaze.

- **Costume Parties:** Social gatherings abound during Harrowsnight, with participants showcasing their creative costumes and engaging in festivities. These gatherings provide a space for the community to come together and revel in the eerie ambiance of the night.

- **Home Decorations:** Homes are transformed into haunting spectacles with spooky themes.

The aim is to create an immersive environment that pays homage to the thinning veil between realms.

- **Hallow Celebrations:** Rituals take place to honor the departed and establish a protective barrier against [[Kryela, goddess of malice, destruction and chaos - The Undoing (CE)|Kryela]]'s influence. These sacred ceremonies serve as a communal expression of reverence for those who have passed, seeking to ensure their safe passage beyond the veil.
