## Introduction

The [[Aeloria|Aelorian]] calendar, meticulously crafted by The Archivists, serves as a structured means to record time in the realms. Initially implemented in the Pendragon Empire, it swiftly gained widespread acceptance across the Veiled Lands. This chronological system was a response to the need for order and organization in historical recordings.

## Calendar Structure

- **Seasons**: [[Aeloria]] experiences four distinct seasons â€” Winter, Spring, Summer, and Autumn. Each season gracefully unfolds over 3 [[Months]], with a [[Months|month]] dedicated to its commencement, apex, and conclusion. This seasonal rhythm reflects the ebb and flow of the mystical forces shaping [[Aeloria]]'s landscape.
- **[[Months]]**: Aligned with the seasons, the calendar comprises 12 [[Months]], each representing a unique facet of the ever-changing [[Aeloria|Aelorian]] world. Winter marks the onset, while autumn gracefully concludes the year.
- **Weeks and Days**: Each [[Months|month]] spans 4 weeks and 2 days, providing a balanced temporal framework. This deliberate structure allows for efficient timekeeping and planning.
- **Days per [[Months|Month]]**: Consistency reigns as every [[Months|month]] consists of 30 days, creating a harmonious rhythm in the [[Aeloria|Aelorian]] way of life.
- **[[Days of The Week|Days per week]]**: A [[Days of The Week|week]] in the [[Aeloria|Aelorian]] calendar unfolds over 7 days. This number is not arbitrary; it corresponds to the appearance of the planetary bodies in the [[Aeloria|Aelorian]] sky. Each of the seven days is associated with one of the main celestial bodies of the [[solar system]], presenting themselves one at a time in a weekly cycle.
- **Total Days in a Year**: The [[Aeloria|Aelorian]] year encompasses a total of 360 days, a carefully calculated duration that aligns with the intricate cosmic dance of [[Aeloria]] around [[Solis]].
- **Lunar Cycle**: Mirroring the natural magic of [[Aeloria]], [[The Moon (Aeloria's)|the moon]] takes precisely a [[Months|month]] to transition from full moon to full moon, adding a celestial touch to the passage of time.
- **Hours, Minutes, and Seconds**: A day in [[Aeloria]] is divided into 24 hours, each hour comprising 60 minutes, and each minute further subdivided into 60 seconds. This meticulous division ensures precise time measurement in the realms.

## Holidays

In the tapestry of [[Aeloria]]'s cultural landscape, holidays play a vital role, uniting its inhabitants in joyous celebrations and reflective moments.

2. **Historic Holidays:** Marking pivotal moments in [[Aeloria]]'s history, these holidays serve as reminders of the past and often carry profound significance. Commemorations of legendary battles, the foundation of influential institutions, or the crowning of revered leaders connect [[Aeloria]]'s present to its storied past, fostering a collective understanding of its history.
