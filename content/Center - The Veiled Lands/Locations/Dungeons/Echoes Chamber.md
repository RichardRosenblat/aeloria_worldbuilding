# Echoes Chamber: A Nexus of Planar Convergence

## Overview

The Echoes Chamber stands as a mysterious location within the depths of a long-lost dungeon in [[Aeloria]]. It is a unique nexus where the [[Feywild]] and [[Shadowfell]] overlap with the [[Material Plane]] simultaneously. This chamber is saturated with portals to both [[Echo planes]], and within its confines, the very rules governing these planes are bent and distorted.

## The Nature of [[Echo Planes]]

Across the vast and enchanting landscape of [[Aeloria]], the [[Echo planes]], an intricate trio encompassing the [[Material Plane]], [[Shadowfell]], and [[Feywild]], reveal a mesmerizing interplay of energies and reflections. In their typical behavior, these planes mirror only the landscapes of each other, orchestrating a harmonious dance of transformation to align with their unique energies and origins. Picture the rolling hills of the [[Material Plane]] transforming into golden fields of luminescent grass in the [[Feywild]], where each blade seems to shimmer with the very essence of magic. Contrastingly, within the [[Shadowfell]]'s grasp, those same hills become foreboding mountains, where the trapped souls of the undead form eerie, spectral formations.

However, despite these stunning metamorphoses of terrain, the [[Echo planes]] adhere to a curious limitationâ€”they never reflect creatures. Individuals traversing the [[Material Plane|prime Material]] Plane find no semblance of their existence mirrored within the other planes. It is a peculiarity that amidst the echoing landscapes, sentient beings stand as enigmatic exceptions. This absence of reflection creates an otherworldly symmetry where the essence of the land undergoes perpetual transformation, while the denizens of [[Aeloria]] remain absent from this spectral ballet. It is a cosmic ballet where the realms reflect in unison, yet the souls within remain untouched by the mirrored dance of [[the planes]].

This peculiar characteristic has long fascinated scholars and adventurers alike, creating an aura of mystery around the [[Echo planes]]. The landscapes may echo and resonate, but the beings that tread upon them remain uniquely anchored to the [[Material Plane|prime Material]] Plane, their reflections lost amidst the ever-shifting tapestry of [[Aeloria]]'s interconnected realms.

## Unraveling the Anomaly

At the heart of the Echoes Chamber lies a small platform, positioned between two gateways leading into the [[Shadowfell]] and [[Feywild]]. These gateways grant a unique perspective, offering distorted reflections of beings present in the chamber. Elves may see a Drow in their [[Shadowfell]] counterpart or an Eladrin in the [[Feywild]] reflection, while humans see a [[Shadowborn]] in the [[Shadowfell]] reflection or a [[Lightborn]] in the [[Feywild]] counterpart, and so on with each race seeing their counterpart.

## The Art of Reflection

Venturing through these gateways allows beings to swap places with their reflections. This enables adventurers to navigate the distinct realms of the [[Feywild]] and [[Shadowfell]], avoiding the adverse effects that these planes can impose.

## Consequences of Unchecked Transitions

However, there are dire consequences for those who linger too long without reversing the switch. Beyond a [[month]], the interplay of planar energies starts to warp the physical forms of the switched bodies.

### [[Shadowfell]] Afflictions

- **Glowing Blisters:** Bodies controlled by [[Feywild]] minds develop radiant blisters that burst, emitting burning light.
- **Virulent Disease:** Bodies controlled by [[Material Plane]] minds in the [[Shadowfell]] reflection succumb to a virulent, necrotic disease.

### [[Feywild]] Transformations

- **Burning Contact:** [[Feywild]] bodies, under the influence of [[Shadowfell]] minds, begin to burn upon contact with parts of the [[Feywild]].
- **Ethereal Dilution:** Bodies controlled by [[Material Plane]] minds in the [[Feywild]] reflection slowly dilute into ethereal energy.

### [[Material Plane]] Distortions

- **Rotting Decay:** Bodies controlled by [[Shadowfell]] minds in the [[Material Plane]] reflection undergo rapid decay and decomposition.
- **Arboreal Transformation:** Bodies controlled by [[Feywild]] minds in the [[Material Plane]] reflection transform into majestic, sentient trees.

In the Echoes Chamber, the delicate balance between planes unravels, presenting both opportunity and peril for those daring enough to traverse its gateways.
