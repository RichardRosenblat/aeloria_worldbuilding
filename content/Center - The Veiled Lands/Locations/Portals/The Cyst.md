# The Cyst

The Cyst is a shell that protects the portal to the prison of [[Tharizdun, God of Madness - The Chained Oblivion (CE)|Tharizdun]]'s mind, a demiplane that orbits the last layer of [[the abyss]].

## Description

The Cyst is a massive, egg-shaped shell made of a thick black and porous stone-like material. The material behaves similar to dead stone, it resists all attempts to damage, transmute, or otherwise affect it using magic or physical force. Any spells cast at the shell are absorbed and redirected back at the caster. 

If not embedded in walls, rocks, or other solid surfaces, the Cyst will float in the air, hovering two feet above the ground. When inspected closely, the shell contains multiple runes and sigils that seem to shift and change when observed. 

The shell is warm to the touch, and a faint hum can be heard when one touches their ear to the surface. 

## Accessing the Portal

To access the portal, one must touch the shell with their bare hand while holding the key to the prison of [[Tharizdun, God of Madness - The Chained Oblivion (CE)|Tharizdun]]'s mind. The key is a small, black, and perfectly smooth grain of sand. When the Cyst activates, the shell will open, revealing a swirling vortex of black and purple energy. 
This portal leads to the prison of [[Tharizdun, God of Madness - The Chained Oblivion (CE)|Tharizdun]]'s mind, transporting only the person who activated the portal and anything or anyone they are touching. Once used, the portal will close, the shell will return to its dormant state and a random grain of sand across the multiverse will turn into the key to the portal.
When leaving the prison, the portal will return the person to the exact location they left from, regardless of the time spen[[True Gods|t in the ]]prison.

## History

The Cyst was created by the [[True Gods]] to contain [[Tharizdun, God of Madness - The Chained Oblivion (CE)|Tharizdun]]'s mind during the [[The Creation (CR)|Creation Era]]. To ensure that the prison would not be accessed by anyone, the [[True Gods]] created the portal to require a key that would be impossible to find. The key was then scattered across the multiverse, ensuring that no one would ever find it.
