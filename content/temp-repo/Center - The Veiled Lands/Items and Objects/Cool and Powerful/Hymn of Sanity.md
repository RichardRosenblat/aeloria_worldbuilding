The hymn of Sanity is a love letter to the world around us, as the natural state of the mind is, in some way, to love. It expresses love for peace, life, death, power, and everything that exists. The anthem wards off insanity and protects the hearts of those who hold its melody in mind. It serves as an anchor for the mind, preventing us from getting lost in the sea of insanity in the [[Astral Plane|astral]] depths and beyond the infinite in the [[The Far Realm|Far Realms]]. The music is a plea to protect the weak and the strong, the kindness and the malice of the shadows that cannot see the beauty in every second around us.
