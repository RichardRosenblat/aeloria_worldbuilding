# Item: Planar Nexus

## Physical Description
The Planar Nexus is a fascinating crystal cube, approximately 10 centimeters in size. Its transparent surface is made of flawless and iridescent crystal, similar to soap bubbles, refracting light and creating a dazzling display of colors. Inside the crystal, intricate patterns of constellations and [[Astronomical objects|nebulae]] seem to come to life, shimmering with a celestial glow. Tiny specks of stardust swirl and twinkle, creating a captivating cosmic dance that evokes a sense of awe and wonder.
At the heart of the cube, nestled amidst the celestial tapestry, is a complex mechanism. Gears, wheels, and delicate watch-like components intertwine with celestial imagery, forming an intricate and harmonious blend of magic and machinery. The mechanism emits a soft hum of arcane energy, radiating a pulsating glow that is in tune with the rhythm of the cosmos.
        
### Opened
When the possessor gazes at the cube and focuses on its power, the cube begins to float, and its facets separate, floating in the air and revealing the celestial bodies within, as well as its internal mechanism. The possessor can see miniaturized replicas of [[the planes]] they have visited, represented by ethereal landscapes, floating islands, and architectural wonders. These miniatures spin and move, offering a glimpse of the vibrant worlds they represent. The constellations and [[Astronomical objects|nebulae]] within the crystal align and reconfigure to match the currently accessible planes, forming a celestial map of cosmology. The [[Astronomical objects|nebulae]] and ethereal landscapes are intangible, causing only a slight sensation of cold when attempting to touch them. If someone touches the internal mechanism or one of the cube's facets, the cube quickly returns to its default state.
        
### Stars
Embedded within the crystal cube, faintly visible, are small bright stars that mimic the night sky. These stars move and flicker, recreating never-before-seen celestial patterns. The constellations change in response to the cube's powers, representing the accessed plane.
        
### Activated
When activated, the mechanism inside the cube comes to life, emitting a soft ticking sound as gears rotate and engage. [[Ethereal Plane|Ethereal]] energy pulses through the crystal, causing the constellations and [[Astronomical objects|nebulae]] to spin and dance more vigorously. The ticking intensifies, synchronizing with the energy and forming a harmonious melody that resonates in the air.
        
## Abilities:
- **Planar Recall:**
        **Charges: 1 / 1**	
	**Recharge: 24 hours**	
	- **Description**		
		Once per day, the possessor of the Planar Nexus can activate its power to transport themselves and up to 6 companions to any plane they have previously visited. By focusing on the desired plane and speaking its name, the cube creates a shimmering portal, allowing safe passage to that plane. The Nexus can only access planes the possessor has experienced firsthand. After each journey, the Nexus needs to accumulate [[Ethereal Plane|ethereal]] energy to ensure the stability of the next portal, so once this ability is used, it becomes unavailable until the possessor completes a long rest or 24 hours have passed since the last use of this ability.
- **Deep Connection:**
	**Charges: 3 / 3**
	**Recharge: `dice: 1d4` days after depleting**
	- **Description**
		Under special circumstances, when the possessor is in a location with a deep connection to a new plane they have not visited before, the Planar Nexus can grant access to that plane. Examples include ancient sites of power, sacred rituals, or places imbued with the essence of the desired plane, either by fate or a significant event. This ability can only be used sparingly and at the discretion of the Dungeon Master. Locations with deep connections are imbued with power that the Nexus uses for travel, so each time a new connection is established, the Nexus recharges a charge of the Planar Anchoring ability. To avoid intense stress on its internal mechanisms when creating a connection, the Nexus refuses to create more than 3 new connections until it needs to recharge for `dice: 1d4` days.
- **Planar Anchoring:**
        **Charges: 4 / 4**
        **Recharge: `dice: 1d2` days after depleting**
        - **Description**
            The Planar Nexus can be activated to anchor the current location of the possessor and their companions. By placing the cube on a stable surface and activating its power, the Nexus establishes a temporary anchoring point. This allows the possessor and up to 4 creatures to return to that specific location on the plane, even if they leave and visit another plane. The anchoring point remains valid until the cube is used to travel to another plane, another anchoring point is created, or after `dice: 1d6` days have passed. During the anchoring process, the cube needs to lock the locations of the affected creatures in its internal cosmology using its accumulated energy, and it can only recreate this feat 4 times before recharging for `dice: 1d2` days.
- **Planar Sight:**
        **Charges: None**
        **Recharge: Always available**
        - **Description**
            The Planar Nexus has the ability to provide vision and information about [[the planes]] the possessor is currently in or has previously visited. By touching the cube and focusing on a specific plane, the user can access a mental repository of knowledge and obtain valuable information about the plane's characteristics, its inhabitants, and notable locations. This information assists in planning and decision-making during the exploration of known planes.
