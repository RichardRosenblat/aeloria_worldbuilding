_My Dearest,_

_I hope these words find you in better times than the ones I now endure. My eyes have witnessed the heavens ablaze, and the depths of hell freezing over. I've seen fish drown, and my ears have borne witness to the deafening roar of a Cataclysm, akin to a Tsar, yet with the chilling distinction that a Tsar shatters eardrums and a Cataclysm shatters hope._

_My love, as you read this dusty letter, know that I may not return home as soon as I'd hoped. My soul has been eternally bound to this muddied earth, and the stars that once illuminated our nights now pave roads with destruction. Love, I stand on the precipice of becoming a ghost, wandering amidst the ashes of these desolate homesâ€”scarred by flames, hatred, misguided patriotism, anger, and the perverse joy of witnessing organs strewn upon the streets._

_Forgive me, for all I ever wished for was a better life for us, a life of peace and prosperity. The songs here bear no resemblance to the melodies of our past. Gods and angels have turned their backs on us, kamikazes soar menacingly overhead, and clouds rain down fires that flood our world._

_The songs here are different, my love. Gods and angels have forsaken us, that impact changed something essencial yet i cannot discern what, clouds devour men now and monsters of our own hubris haunt us. These are the haunting refrains of a world forever changed._

_With all my love, Gasparov_
