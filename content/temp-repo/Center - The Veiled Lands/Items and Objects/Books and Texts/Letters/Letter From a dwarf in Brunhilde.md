My Dearest Gyda,

I hope this letter finds you well and thriving in the distant lands beyond our mighty mountains. The halls of Brunhilde echo with tales of your exploits, and I often find myself lost in memories of the days we spent together. How I wish you were here to witness the unfolding tale of a gentle and caring soul named Thrud.

Thrud, with eyes as deep as the sea we once read about in our childhood tales, entered my store many moons after your departure. Her beauty, a radiance akin to the [[Solis|sun]], left me momentarily speechless. She commissioned decorative shields for her parent's dwelling, and it was then that our paths intertwined. Her hair, like red roses and copper wires, frames a face that could rival the fairest visions from our dreams.

Despite her outward strength, Thrud carries a burden few can fathom. She possesses a zealous heart, a warrior's spirit, but a soul divided. Thrud, in her compassion, takes on the pains of others as her own, experiencing them in secret. She is a beacon of love, yet a captive to a responsibility she fears to shatterâ€”the ancestral home of Brunhilde, where her family's roots run deep.

Thrud dreams of the sea, a desire that tugs at her very core. Yet, like the unknown waters, she fears what lies beneath the surface of her own emotions. A complex relationship with the depths within herself, a metaphorical monster keeping her captive to duty.

In a moment of vulnerability, she confided in me, revealing the loss of the fruit of her womb and a distant father who offers little in the way of paternal comfort. Her words, like axes thrown at my heart, echoed with the pain she carries.

Gyda, I find myself drawn to Thrud in ways beyond friendship. I am willing to be whatever she needs, offering support and understanding in exchange for a smile or some time. Yet, my heart is burdened with the fear of confessing my deep love for her, for I am uncertain if she shares the same sentiments. I write this to you in search of guidance, as the weight of my emotions threatens to overwhelm me.

May your adventures be filled with joy and triumph, and may the winds of fate guide you back to our ancestral halls someday.

With Love,

Jorn
