- Marcus Valerian was an adventurer that tried exploring the world because he had a great thirst for adventure and his heart longed for adventure
- His boat was called "Arcanogia"
- Marcus was already familiar with Dead Stone or it already appeared in his home continent, where it the material was specially rare, only being found in the format of small rocks in some of the oldest ruins across the Kor'Talor, but the material had only value for it's rarity since it could not be used for any application since it never changes form not even by magic or heat or any other mean
-  And Marcus calls the “The [[Whistling Fields]]” that name because that was what his crew called the place every time it was brought up.
- He was born in the year 85 YE and died in 135 YE, having lived 135 years
- his home kingdom is called Ymirheim and his home continent Kor’Talor
- He wrote the book [[Beyond the maw]] talking about his adventures in the Serpent's Maw Ocean
- He ended up sailing to an unnamed big island somewhere far in the Serpent’s Maw Ocean 
- the island had a great forest and Marcus decided to go exploring, he kept walking and noticed the forest starting to wilt and perish as they ventured deeper into the forest and found the [[Whistling Fields]]
- He mourns the loss of 6 of his crew-mates while he was in the [[Whistling Fields]] as they fell victim of the [[Whistling Fields#^7280d2|Osseous Embrace]] 
- He spend 5 days in the fields ^7e90ab
  1. in the first day nothing happened they just explored the location, but they lost track of one of the crew members(A female dwarf named Borindil)
  2. on the second day while Marcus was talking to a crew member (An elven male called Gulintras)  that was foraging with him for any material to make a fire, he lost eyesight of his Gulintras, and then Gulintras stopped answering, when Marcus came to check he found that Gulintras was taken by the Osseous Embrace
  3. On the third day the crew found the skeleton and clothes of Borindil, and some hours after another crewmember was found be taken by the Ossesous Embrace (a human male called Mintras) by Marcus, the crew decided to leave the place by finishing exploring it and going through the fields until it's end, and then circuling the fields on the way back to the ship
  4. On the morning of the fourth day they found the skeleton of another crewmember (Aryl, a female tiefling), that made the crew change their plans and decide to leave the fields and go back to the ship by going back the way they came
  5. the last day the crew lost 2 men at the same time, (Patyr and Ahlor both human males) Patyr was helping Ahlor to calm down because he was scared of the place, Ahlor was crying loudly under a big spike while Patyr tried to help him calm down, Marcus was watching and went to drink from his canteen, when the crying suddenly stopped, when Marcus looked back he saw the skeleton and clothes of both men, that struck fear into the hearts of the crew and they decided to leave the place immediately, Marcus was the last one to leave the fields, and he was running scared and terrified by the place with what remained of his crew
