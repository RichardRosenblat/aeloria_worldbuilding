During the Eon known as the "Old World," a span of 80 thousand years between 100 thousand and 20 thousand years ago, the celestial realms of [[Aeloria]] were witness to the profound discord among the [[True Gods]]. This era unfolded in distinct phases, from the emergence of the [[Defiant Gods]] challenging the status quo to the harmonious counterbalance presented by the [[Harmonious Gods|Harmonious Deities]]. As the cosmic forces teetered on the edge of chaos, an unlikely alliance between these celestial factions formed in the face of a greater threat. Dragons, born of collaboration between [[Bahamut, God  of justice and nobility - The Platinum Dragon (LG)|Bahamut]] and Tiamat, played a pivotal role in containing primordial forces and shaping the world's destiny. This intricate dance of divine influence, cosmic conflict, and the birth of powerful beings marked the Old World, setting the stage for the subsequent Great War and the eventual intervention of [[Over-Deities|the twin goddesses]], [[Aena, goddess of kindness, creation and order - The Architect (LG)|Aena]] and [[Kryela, goddess of malice, destruction and chaos - The Undoing (LE)|Kryela]], ushering in [[The Divine Accord]] and a new era of healing and balance.
