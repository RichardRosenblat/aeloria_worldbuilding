# The plane of Ether

The Ethereal Plane is a misty, fog-bound dimension. Its "shores," called the [[Border Ethereal]], overlap the [[Material Plane]] and the [[Metaphysical Planes|Inner Planes]], so that every location on those planes has a corresponding location on the Ethereal Plane. Visibility in the [[Border Ethereal]] is limited to 60 feet. The plane's depths comprise a region of swirling mist and fog called the Deep Ethereal, where visibility is limited to 30 feet.

Characters can use the etherealness spell to enter the [[Border Ethereal]]. The plane shift spell allows transport to the [[Border Ethereal]] or the Deep Ethereal, but unless the intended destination is a specific location or a teleportation circle, the point of arrival could be anywhere on the plane.

## [[Border Ethereal]]

From the [[Border Ethereal]], a traveler can see into whatever plane it overlaps, but that plane appears muted and indistinct, its colors blurring into each other and its edges turning fuzzy. Ethereal denizens watch the plane as though peering through distorted and frosted glass, and can't see anything beyond 30 feet into the other plane. Conversely, the Ethereal Plane is usually invisible to those on the overlapped planes, except with the aid of magic.

Normally, creatures in the [[Border Ethereal]] can't attack creatures on the overlapped plane, and vice versa. A traveler on the Ethereal Plane is invisible and utterly silent to someone on the overlapped plane, and solid objects on the overlapped plane don't hamper the movement of a creature in the [[Border Ethereal]]. The exceptions are certain magical effects (including anything made of magical force) and living beings. This makes the Ethereal Plane ideal for reconnaissance, spying on opponents, and moving around without being detected. The Ethereal Plane also disobeys the laws of gravity; a creature there can move up and down as easily as walking.

### Sea of Ether:

Hidden within the veils of the [[Border Ethereal]] that intertwines with the [[Material Plane]] lies the enigmatic Sea of Ether, also called The Medium. Unlike the ethereal mists that typically define this plane, the Sea of Ether is a unique expanse that manifests exclusively within the overlapping boundaries of the [[Material Plane]]. As denizens of the [[Material Plane]] traverse the vast emptiness of [[Solar System|Wildspace]], they unknowingly encounter a vacuum devoid of atmosphere. Yet, with the aid of magic, those who pierce the veil into the Ethereal Plane find themselves immersed in the ethereal depths of the Sea of Ether.

The Sea of Ether is an expansive liquid realm akin to water, yet it is not meant for mortal breath. This ethereal substance, also known as Ether, flows in varied speeds and directions around the celestial bodies, forming currents that some skilled navigators employ to propel their magical vessels. Situated at the heart of the [[solar system]], this liquid Ether extinguishes non-magical flames and defines the borders of the cosmic sea beyond the last planet.

Traversing the Sea of Ether is unlike the ethereal travel experienced in the regular plane. Travelers cannot effortlessly move with their minds; instead, they must manipulate the Ether, pushing it to create propulsion. When in contact with Ether, a subtle numbness pervades the body, and exposure to its vapors can induce [unconsciousness](https://5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#unconscious_phb).

Despite the zero gravity experienced within the Sea of Ether, the liquid possesses peculiar buoyancy properties. While many materials remain unaffected, some react dynamically, moving in specific directions relative to the center of the Sea or the mathematical plane of the [[solar system]], floating up or downwards, and even being pulled into the [[Solis|sun]]. The Ether's influence extends to the edge of a planet's atmosphere, creating a protective bubble around it. Traversing this boundary transports travelers back to the regular [[Border Ethereal]] of the planet.

Within the ethereal currents, adventurers may chance upon bubbles of breathable air. Upon entry, these bubbles create an attraction force similar to gravity, drawing travelers toward the most massive object within the bubble. Navigating this ethereal sea demands not only magical prowess but an understanding of the ever-shifting currents and the celestial dance of the cosmos. The Sea of Ether, a hidden gem within the vast expanse of the Ethereal Plane, invites those brave enough to explore its liquid mysteries.


## Deep Ethereal

To reach the Deep Ethereal, one needs a plane shift spell or arrive by means of a gate spell or magical portal

Visitors to the Deep Ethereal are engulfed by roiling mist. Scattered throughout the plane are curtains of vaporous color, and passing through a curtain leads a traveler to a region of the [[Border Ethereal]] connected to a specific Inner Plane, the [[Material Plane]], the [[Feywild]], or the [[Shadowfell]]. The color of the curtain indicates the plane whose [[Border Ethereal]] the curtain conceals; see the Ethereal Curtains table.

Traveling through the Deep Ethereal to journey from one plane to another is unlike physical travel. Distance is meaningless, so although travelers feel as if they can move by a simple act of will, it's impossible to measure speed and hard to track the passage of time. A trip between planes through the Deep Ethereal takes `dice: 1d10*10` hours, regardless of the origin and destination. In combat, however, creatures are considered to move at their normal speeds.

## Ether Cyclones

An ether cyclone is a serpentine column that spins through the plane. The cyclone appears abruptly, distorting and uprooting ethereal forms in its path and carrying the debris for leagues. Travelers with a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 15 or more receive `dice: 1d4` rounds of warning: a deep hum in the ethereal matter.

Travelers who can't reach a curtain or portal leading elsewhere suffer the cyclone's effect. Roll a `dice: 1d20` and consult the Ether Cyclone table to determine the effect on all creatures in the vicinity.

### Ether Cyclones

`dice: 1d20`

|d20|Effect|
|---|---|
|1-12|Extended journey|
|13-19|Blown to the [[Border Ethereal]] of a random plane (roll on the Ethereal Curtains table)|
|20|Hurled into the [[Astral Plane]]|

The most common effect of an ether cyclone is to extend the duration of a journey. Each character in a group traveling together must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. If at least half the group succeeds, travel is delayed by `dice: 1d10` hours. Otherwise, the journey's travel time is doubled. Less often, a group is blown into the [[Border Ethereal]] of a random plane. Rarely, the cyclone tears a hole in the fabric of the plane and hurls the party into the [[Astral Plane]].

## Ethereal Plane Encounters

Most encounters in the [[Border Ethereal]] are with creatures on the [[Material Plane]] whose senses or abilities extend into the Ethereal Plane (phase spiders, for example). Ghosts also move freely between the Ethereal and Material Planes.

In the Deep Ethereal, most encounters are with other travelers, particularly ones from the [[Metaphysical Planes|Inner Planes]] (such as elementals, genies, and salamanders), as well as the occasional celestial, fiend, or fey.
