# Air | Open Skies with Clouds

- Elemental Theme:
	The primary elemental theme of the plane is air. The plane is predominantly associated with the control of air and wind, with its characteristics and challenges shaped by the presence of these elements.

- Plane Structure:
	The elemental plane of air is a vast sky with intense and random winds and huge clouds that spread for kilometers, with distinct areas dedicated to different manifestations of the element. These regions interact with each other through air currents and wind flows, creating a dynamic and fluid environment.

- Elemental Inhabitants:
	Air elemental creatures are native to this plane, including sylphs and djinn. These creatures have a natural affinity for the element, being able to manipulate air and fly with ease. Additionally, other fantastic creatures such as griffins and harpies can also be found in this plane, adapted to the aerial conditions.

- Elemental Manifestations:
	Unique manifestations of elemental forces in the plane of air include strong winds that can form violent storms, air currents that create vortexes and whirlwinds, and clouds charged with static electricity. These manifestations affect the environment and its inhabitants, creating atmospheric turbulence, rapid climate changes, and aerial navigation challenges.

- Elemental Magic:
	The elemental energies of air influence magic in this plane significantly. Air and wind-related spells are more powerful and effective, allowing practitioners to manipulate air currents, create gusts of wind, and even summon storms. Inhabitants of the plane can develop new spells and unique magical abilities, such as free flight or creating protective wind barriers.

- Plane Attributes:
	Specific planar characteristics associated with this elemental plane include normal gravity but with ascending and descending air currents in various regions. The plane is marked by temperature variations, from cold and freezing areas at high altitudes to warmer and more humid areas near the lower regions. Time flows regularly, with rapid weather changes and turbulent winds.

- Plane's Purpose:
	The purpose of the elemental plane of air is to serve as a source of energy and freedom. It represents the essence of breath and movement, powering the multiverse with fresh and renewing winds. Additionally, this plane plays an important role in maintaining elemental balance, interacting with other planes and bringing the influence of air to harmonize the forces.

- Encounters in the Plane:
	When exploring the elemental plane of air, players may face challenges such as hostile air-associated creatures like wind elementals and mystical beings from the heights. They may also encounter powerful elemental air guardians, who protect sacred areas or guard aerodynamic treasures. Treasures and resources in this plane may include magical items related to air, such as enchanted wings, wind scrolls, and flying artifacts.

- Plane Entry and Exit:
	Entries and exits to the [[Material Plane]] from the elemental plane of air can be accessed through special portals. These portals can be found in high mountains, floating ship graveyards and giant storms. Certain magical items, such as enchanted feathers or wind amulets, may be required to open or close these portals. The plane also has connections to the [[Plane of Water]] and to the [[Plane of Fire]], creating regions considered subplanes of snow and smoke respectively

- Plane Hazards:
	Inherent dangers present in the elemental plane of air include violent storms that can disorient and harm travelers. Strong winds can create powerful air currents that can drag the unwary away or drop them from great heights. Additionally, the lack of solid footing can be dangerous for those who cannot fly or are unprepared to face aerial adversities.

- Elemental Cities:
	Within the elemental plane of air, there are suspended cities and settlements adapted to the elemental forces around them. Some cities are built on floating platforms or connected by aerial bridges, while others are located on high floating cloud peaks where the winds are stronger. The constructions in these cities are designed to withstand air currents and may include tall towers and open balconies.

- Elemental Landmarks:
	Unique and significant landmarks scattered throughout the elemental plane of air include columns of suspended clouds, where travelers can rest or get guidance. There are also observation towers erected in the heights, allowing for a panoramic view of the plane and beyond. Statues of winged creatures, made of solidified air, can be found in sacred locations or as monuments to the greatness of the plane.

- Elemental Landscapes:
	The distinct and fascinating landscapes present in the elemental plane of air are formed by vast open skies, with fluffy white clouds floating in an infinite horizon. Floating cities rise above the clouds, while air currents and winds play among suspended rock formations. Windy valleys and swirling vortexes can also be found, where gravity seems to act strangely. Each of these landscapes offers a unique atmosphere, with challenges and wonders that players can explore, from ethereal heights to the depths of wind canyons.
