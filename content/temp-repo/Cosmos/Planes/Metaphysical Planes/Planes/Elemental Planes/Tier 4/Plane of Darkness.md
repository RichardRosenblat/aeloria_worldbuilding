- Plane Structure:
	The Darkness plane is divided into distinct regions, each with unique characteristics. There are areas shrouded in dense shadows where light is almost nonexistent, and others with dark mist that obscures vision. The regions interact intriguingly, creating a mysterious and immersive atmosphere.

- Elemental Inhabitants:

- Elemental Manifestations:

Dark smoke fills the air, enveloping landscapes and making visibility difficult. These manifestations affect the environment, creating an air of mystery and concealment.

- Elemental Magic:
	Magic in this plane is deeply influenced by darkness. Users of shadow magic have an easier time casting spells of illusion, enchantment, and necromancy. Additionally, they can create shadow constructs for protection or attack. Dense smoke can also be manipulated to create illusions and hinder the vision of opponents.

- Plane Attributes:

Buildings are designed to blend with the shadows and may be adorned with intricate patterns of dancing shadows.
