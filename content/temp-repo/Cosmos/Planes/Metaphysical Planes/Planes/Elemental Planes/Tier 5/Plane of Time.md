# Time| A Desert with Hourglasses and Gears Changing the Flow of Time

- Elemental Theme:
	The primary elemental theme of the plane is Time. The control of the flow of time is the central essence of this plane, inspired by deserts, hourglasses, and gears. Inhabitants of this plane have the ability to make small alterations to time, slowing down or speeding up its flow, time travel, and even creating temporal distortion fields.

- Plane Structure:
	The Time plane consists of several distinct regions, each reflecting a unique facet of time. There are vast desert regions where the sand flows slowly, and dunes stretch as far as the eye can see. Other regions are dominated by immense hourglasses, where time seems to flow in a constant stream. There are also areas with mechanical landscapes, where giant gears rotate and govern time around them. These regions interact with each other, creating a complex balance of different temporal flows.

- Elemental Inhabitants:
	Elemental inhabitants of this plane include beings with an innate affinity for time. They can be called Chronos, beings who can skillfully and precisely manipulate time. Additionally, there are guardians of time, powerful entities that protect the integrity of the temporal flow and ensure that no harmful interference occurs. Magical creatures associated with time, such as temporal phoenixes or chronological dragons, can also be found in this plane.

- Elemental Manifestations:
	Elemental manifestations in this plane are varied and fascinating. In the desert regions, sandstorms can sweep travelers into past or future moments. In areas with hourglasses, time flows at a constant and predictable pace, providing a sense of stability and order. In mechanical landscapes, giant gears turn in synchrony, dictating the rhythm of time around them. The environment is filled with glimpses of past, present, and future events, creating an atmosphere of mystery and temporal possibilities.

- Elemental Magic:
	Magic in this plane is heavily influenced by the power of time. Spells related to time manipulation are more accessible and powerful in this plane. Magic users can slow down or speed up time in a specific area, create temporal illusions, and even time travel in limited ways. Additionally, new spells and unique magical abilities can be discovered, allowing spellcasters to explore the nuances and complexities of the temporal flow.

- Plane Attributes:
	In this elemental plane of Time, the passage of time does not follow the same rules as the [[Material Plane]]. Time can flow in a non-linear fashion, allowing events from the past, present, and future to overlap. The environment can have extreme temperature variations, with areas of intense heat and others of freezing cold. Gravity can be influenced by the flow of time, creating areas where gravity is weaker or stronger. These peculiarities of the plane add unique challenges and opportunities for adventurers.

- Plane's Purpose:
	The purpose of the elemental Time plane is to serve as a realm of temporal balance in the multiverse. It is intrinsically connected to other planes and dimensions, allowing passage between them through temporal portals. The plane serves as a source of energy and knowledge about time, and its stability is crucial for the harmony of the multiverse.

- Encounters in the Plane:
	While exploring the elemental Time plane, players may encounter challenges such as guardians of time, powerful entities that protect the integrity of the temporal flow. They may encounter magical creatures associated with time, such as temporal phoenixes or chronological dragons, which possess valuable knowledge about temporal nuances. Additionally, rare treasures, mystical artifacts, and temporal resources can be discovered in this plane, offering players unique opportunities for progression and enhancement.

- Plane Entry and Exit:
	Entry and exit from the elemental Time plane are complex and intricate temporal portals. These portals can be activated through precise rituals, involving the manipulation of special hourglasses or the precise alignment of mystical gears. Additionally, certain magical items, such as ancient clocks or chronometric amulets, can allow access to this plane. However, closing these portals requires a deep understanding of the temporal flow and the execution of specific rituals.

- Plane Hazards:
	Hazards in this plane are related to the complex and volatile nature of time. Players may encounter unstable temporal flows, which can distort reality and cause temporal harm to travelers. There are areas where time flows rapidly, rapidly aging those who venture there, and areas where time is stagnant, trapping the unwary in a temporal loop. Additionally, interference with the flow of time can attract the attention of dangerous forces, such as temporal paradoxes or aberrant time creatures.

- Elemental Cities:
	Cities within the elemental Time plane are fascinating constructions that incorporate elements of hourglasses and gears. Streets follow circular movement patterns, and houses and buildings have a mechanical aesthetic, with ornamental gears and timekeeping devices. Inhabitants of these cities live in synchrony with the flow of time, following meticulously timed routines. Daily life is marked by seasonal festivals and celebrations that honor the temporal flow.

- Elemental Landmarks:
	Landmarks in this elemental plane include markers that represent the passage of time. There may be an immense central hourglass that regulates time in the plane, visible from afar and revered as a symbol of stability. There are also magical gardens where flowers bloom and wither in a matter of seconds, showcasing the ephemeral nature of time. Giant statues of legendary figures related to time, such as an ancient chrononaut or a timeless being, can be found in strategic locations, guarding long-forgotten secrets and knowledge.

- Elemental Landscapes:
	Landscapes in the elemental Time plane are truly unique. Deserts stretch with undulating dunes, where time seems suspended, creating a sense of immobility. Giant hourglasses rise from the ground, their sands flowing from one chamber to another, representing the inexorable passage of time. In mechanical areas, landscapes of colossal gears rotate in harmony, creating intricate patterns and peculiar temporal rhythms. The plane's sky is marked by moving constellations that trace complex paths over time.
