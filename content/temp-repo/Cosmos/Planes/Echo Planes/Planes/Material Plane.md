# The Prime Material Plane

The prime material is the bedrock of the cosmology, it is fed raw magic and material lattice from the [[Metaphysical Planes]] and it's residents' thought and mental energy affect directly the [[Metapsychic Planes]] while it is the plane that is echoed by the other [[Echo Planes]], being the central plane that touches both [[Liminal Planes]]. 
The plane roots the entire cosmology, allowing the interaction between all other planes and easy travel between them
The plane exist in a [[Solar System]] and it contains multiple planets, usually when refereeing to the Prime Material Plane, it is meant the planet [[Aeloria]]
