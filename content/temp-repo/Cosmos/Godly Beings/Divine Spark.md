# Divine Sparks and their properties

## Introduction

The essence of godly beings is encapsulated in enigmatic sources known as Divine Sparks. These sparks, varying in types, hold the key to the distinctiveness of each divine being within the intricate tapestry of existence.

## Nature of Divine Sparks

### Composition:

Unraveling the essence of Divine Sparks reveals an extraordinary composition - immense levels of Metadynamic energy. More specifically, these divine sparks are composed of existential metadynamic energy, pulsating with cosmic power that defines reality itself.

### Flame-like Core:

At their core, Divine Sparks possess a dynamic nature, akin to immaterial flames. These divine essences can spread, be extinguished, stolen, or rekindled, functioning as fuel sources for the godly entities that wield them. They burn brightly, perpetually guarded by the vigilant protection of their wielders, their luminosity a testament to the enduring power created bt [[Over-Deities|the twin goddesses]].

### Destruction of the Divine Spark

The Divine Spark is an anchor that connects a god to the fabric of reality. To extinguish this spark, one must navigate through layers of divine protection and cosmic barriers. The act of destroying or separating the Divine Spark from the god's entity is an unparalleled feat, requiring immense power and often involving intricate rituals or artifacts. The death of such divine being, is the birth of a [[Dead Gods|Dead God]]

### Return to the [[Over-Deities]]

If a god is killed and their divine spark is not absorbed by another entity, it dissipates into existential metadynamic energy, returning to [[Aena, goddess of kindness, creation and order - The Architect (LG)|Aena]] and [[Kryela, goddess of malice, destruction and chaos - The Undoing (LE)|Kryela]], the [[Over-Deities|Twin Goddesses]], to then be returned to reality.

## Origin and Creation

### Original Divine Sparks:

A limited number of original Divine Sparks exist, crafted in the cosmic atelier by the [[over-deities]] [[Aena, goddess of kindness, creation and order - The Architect (LG)|Aena]] and [[Kryela, goddess of malice, destruction and chaos - The Undoing (LE)|Kryela]]. These sparks are unique and unparalleled, serving as the primordial source from which all other variations derive.

### Creation of Divine Sparks:

In ages past, various methods existed for the creation of original Divine Sparks other than by the hands of the [[over-deities]]. Be it through theft or utilizing existing sparks to kindle new ones, the process was shrouded in mystery and intrigue.

## Derivation of Types:

All godly beings possess divine sparks, each a derivative of the original ones. These variations showcase the diverse applications of raw Metadynamic energy, giving rise to a multitude of divine entities with unique attributes and characteristics.

In contrast, the [[over-deities]] [[Aena, goddess of kindness, creation and order - The Architect (LG)|Aena]] and [[Kryela, goddess of malice, destruction and chaos - The Undoing (LE)|Kryela]] transcend the realm of Divine Sparks. Unlike their divine counterparts, their source of power emanates from the mysterious Axiomatic Nullity, a force that distinguishes them from the pantheon they oversee.

### Types of Divine Sparks

#### Axiomatic Nullity

The Axiomatic Nullity is a fascinating concept that powers [[Over-Deities]]. Unlike traditional godly entities with Divine sparks, [[Over-deities]] derive their foundational essence from the Axiomatic Nullity. This abstract principle is intricately woven from the fabric of mathematical paradoxes, resembling the essence of Imaginary numbers and transcending the boundaries of conventional reality. Unlike a mere absence, the Axiomatic Nullity represents a profound presence of non-being that births existence through its very negation. The paradox finds expression in the Limit of infinite dimensions, a ceaseless cycle that grows into itself, creating a confined infinite existence. This cosmic mathematical Function, a self-referential abstraction, defies conventional understanding and mirrors a perpetual dance of creation and destruction. The Axiomatic Nullity, existing at the intersection of mathematical abstraction and cosmic reality, shapes the divine might of [[Aena, goddess of kindness, creation and order - The Architect (LG)|Aena]] and [[Kryela, goddess of malice, destruction and chaos - The Undoing (LE)|Kryela]], serving as a paradoxical wellspring from which their influence emanates, intricately weaving the cosmic tapestry with the threads of infinite dimensions and unending mathematical intricacies.

#### Original Divine Sparks
The Original divine sparks are a unique and potent force that lies at the core of their existence. Crafted by the [[Over-Deities]] [[Aena, goddess of kindness, creation and order - The Architect (LG)|Aena]] and [[Kryela, goddess of malice, destruction and chaos - The Undoing (LE)|Kryela]], these divine essences grant [[True Gods]] unparalleled power.

These sparks represent the essence of desire and behavior patterns that shape energies within reality. Unlike other godly beings, [[True Gods]] lack physical bodies, existing as immaterial entities. To interact with the mortal realm, [[True Gods]] employ Avatars—physical manifestations that embody their divine essence and will.

[[True Gods]]' divine sparks are the only one to gain and lose power based on the devotion of their worshippers. The culture and beliefs of the worshippers can also influence the form of a [[True Gods|True God]]'s [[True Gods|avatar]]. A god without worshippers will lose immense power; their spark will weaken and become akin to an ember, eventually dying if no one remembers them. In contrast, a god followed by a massive group of people will become stronger, and their domain will grow. Their divine spark will burn bright like a [[Solis|sun]], allowing them to create more powerful miracles, bestow stronger powers, and much more.

In the unfortunate event of the death of a [[True Gods|True God]], it implies that their divine spark is snuffed out or has been stolen. This profound loss marks the extinguishing of a celestial force that once held dominion over aspects of existence.

#### Secondary Divine Sparks
The Secondary Divine Sparks are a distinctive force that powers [[Semi-Deities]] and sets them apart from [[True Gods]]. Highly powerful beings, crafted by the [[True Gods]], carry them. Their secondary nature is crucial distinction from the Original Divine Sparks bestowed upon [[True Gods]]. Each semi-deity is marked by a specific goal or mission, their divine spark persists even after such goal is completed.

#### Ephemeral Divine Sparks
Ephemeral Divine sparks are carried by [[Godly Aspects|Aspects]], a stark contrast to the enduring Original divine spark carried by [[True Gods]]. This ephemeral nature grants them limited existence, created and summoned for specific purposes. Once their mission is accomplished or conditions met, Aspects dissipate, returning divine power to their creators.

#### Kindling Divine Sparks
The Kindling Divine Sparks are held by [[Ascended Beings]], mortal vessels channeling power from [[True Gods]]. Upon an Ascended Being's death, the divine essence, disconnected from the soul, erodes it irreversibly. The stolen energy of a [[True Gods|true god]]'s power grants potent but limited abilities to [[Ascended Beings]]. Additionally [[True Gods]] are conscious of those siphoning their power, experiencing minimal weakening and gaining constant knowledge of the offenders' locations.

#### Unstable Divine Sparks
Unstable Divine Sparks are wielded by [[Titans]], these remarkable beings possess a divine spark similar to that of [[True Gods]] that created them, albeit with a distinctive characteristic. Unlike the stable and controlled divine sparks of [[True Gods]], the divine sparks within [[titans]] are inherently unstable. Originating from the inadvertent overflow of power during their creation by [[True Gods]], these unstable divine sparks contribute to the [[titans]]' unpredictable and immense power. The divine sparks within [[titans]] occasionally manifest bursts of divine energy at their core.
