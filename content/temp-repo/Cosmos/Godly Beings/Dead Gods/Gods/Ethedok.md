# Ethedok: A Mysterious Demise

## The Enigmatic Ethedok

Ethedok, one of the divine children born within [[the Eternal Workshop]], remains a figure shrouded in mystery. Little is known about this enigmatic being, as the records of time hold only fragments of whispers about his existence.

## A Tragic End

In the moments of creation, when the cosmic forces were still coalescing, Ethedok met a fate both tragic and abrupt. The Abomination known as "The Red End," emerging from the depths of madness, cast its ominous shadow over the nascent realms.

## Devoured by The Red End

Bravely standing against the encroaching terror alongside [[Vordo]], Ethedok's valiant efforts were not enough to escape the insatiable maw of The Red End. In a cruel twist of destiny, Ethedok was consumed by the voracious hunger of this eldritch horror.

## Echoes of Sacrifice

The sacrifice of Ethedok echoed through the cosmic tapestry, leaving behind unanswered questions and a void in the divine pantheon. His untimely demise in the throes of creation stands as a testament to the unpredictable and perilous nature of the battles waged within [[the Eternal Workshop]].

## Legacy in Shadows

As the eons passed, Ethedok's name became a fleeting whisper in the corridors of celestial history. The details of his essence, powers, and the potential contributions he could have made to the cosmic balance were lost in the shadows cast by The Red End.

## A Symbol of [[the Far Realm]]'s Toll

Ethedok's story remains a poignant symbol of the toll exacted by [[the Far Realm]]'s madness, a reminder that even the divine offspring of [[Aena, goddess of kindness, creation and order - The Architect (LG)|Aena]] and [[Kryela, goddess of malice, destruction and chaos - The Undoing (LE)|Kryela]] were not immune to the cosmic struggles that unfolded in the tumultuous dance between creation and eldritch chaos.
