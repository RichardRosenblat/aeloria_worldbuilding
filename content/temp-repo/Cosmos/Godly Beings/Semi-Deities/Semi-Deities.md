# Semi-Deities in [[Aeloria]]

## Introduction

In the expansive universe of [[Aeloria]], semi-deities stand as highly powerful beings, distinct from the [[True Gods]]. These entities are unique creations of the gods, existing independently of mortal interactions and without control over the affairs of mortals.

## [[Divine Spark|Divine Sparks]]

All semi-deities possess a [[divine spark]] akin to the [[True Gods]], but there is a crucial distinction. While [[True Gods]] are bestowed with the Original [[Divine Spark]], semi-deities are imbued with Secondary [[Divine Spark|Divine Sparks]]. These secondary sparks are crafted by the gods themselves, and unlike [[True Gods]], semi-deities do not derive power from worshippers. Their power is fixed, ensuring they do not weaken in obscurity, yet they do not grow stronger even if they amass numerous followers.

## Purposeful Existence

Every semi-deity in [[Aeloria]] is imbued with a purpose, whether known or shrouded in mystery. Despite lacking worshippers, they tirelessly work to fulfill this purpose, contributing to the intricate balance of existence in the world. This balance is a testament to the interplay of opposing forces.

## Unending Purpose

A semi-deity's purpose is often unending, such as protecting a sacred ground, traveling through [[the planes]], or even cataloging all of time. But, in the case of a semi-deity finishing their job or their purpose, they will either search for a new purpose or return to their creator deity to give back the energy that was used in their creation.

## Independent Will and [[The Divine Accord|Divine Accord]]

All semi-deities are their own beings with their own will, yet they always work to fulfill their purpose in devotion to their creator. Since they are free thinkers, they are allowed by the divine law of [[the Divine Accord]] to exist in the [[Material Plane]].
