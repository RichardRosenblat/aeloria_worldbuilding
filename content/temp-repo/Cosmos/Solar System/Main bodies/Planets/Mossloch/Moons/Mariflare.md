# Mariflare

Mariflare is a captivating moon of [[Mossloch]] that boasts vast oceans, teeming with a diverse array of marine life and breathtaking underwater landscapes. The celestial body is characterized by perpetual water flows that gracefully break the surface, extending into the skies as mesmerizing flares. These flares are often adorned with vibrant colors, courtesy of algae that seamlessly blend into the water before dissipating.

## Name

## Description

Mariflare's defining feature is its expansive and richly populated oceans, providing a habitat for a myriad of marine species. The underwater landscapes of the moon are a testament to the wonders of aquatic life, featuring intricate coral reefs, underwater caves, and vibrant ecosystems. The constant flows of water that breach the surface create a dynamic and ever-changing environment on Mariflare.

## Appearance in Telescope
