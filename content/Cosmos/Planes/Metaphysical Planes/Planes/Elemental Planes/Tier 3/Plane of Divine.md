# Divine | A Plane with No Gravity and Radiated by Divine Light at Its Center

- Elemental Theme:
	The primary elemental theme of this plane is Divinity. This plane is permeated by divine energy, being a realm of light and blessings. Divine light is the central element, and its characteristics and powers are grounded in this sacred energy.

- Plane Structure:
	The Divine plane does not follow the same laws of gravity as the [[Material Plane]]. There is no force of attraction that keeps beings and objects on the ground. Instead, inhabitants float freely through the air often creating cities around floating islands and spherical stones. The plane consists of a single bright and radiant [[Solis|sun]] that iluminantes the entire plane and that extend in all directions, creating an infinite space of divine light. There are no distinct regions dedicated to different elements, as divine energy permeates the entire plane uniformly.

- Elemental Inhabitants:
	Inhabitants of the Divine plane are godly beings and blessed creatures. Angels, devas, seraphim, and other celestial beings use this plane as a safe haven for recovering strength. Additionally, clerics and paladins dedicated to [[Harmonious Gods|benevolent deities]] can find refuge and power in this realm. These divine entities are dedicated to protecting, healing, and inspiring other beings, spreading divine light and combating evil.

- Elemental Manifestations:
	In the Divine plane, divine light is the primordial manifestation. The plane is constantly radiated by intense sacred light that illuminates everything around it. This light does not blind or cause discomfort to inhabitants but brings a sense of peace and protection. Colors are vivid and bright, with golden, silver, and celestial tones. The surroundings are filled with luminous forms, such as sparkling mists and rays of divine light dancing through the air. These manifestations affect the environment, providing a sense of serenity and inspiration to those who inhabit the plane.

- Elemental Magic:
	Divine energy alters the nature of magic in this plane. Spells and magical abilities associated with divinity are more potent and effective. Users of this divine magic can bestow blessings, heal godly beings, remove powerful curses, and even create blessed objects, food, and water. They can summon divine light as a weapon against infernal and demonic beings, causing appropriate damage to these evil creatures.

- Plane Attributes:
	In the Divine plane, there is no conventional gravity. Beings and objects float freely through the air, defying the notion of up and down. Divine light radiates from all directions, providing soft and radiant illumination throughout the plane. The temperature is comfortable and pleasant, conveying a sense of warmth and well-being. Time flows regularly, similar to the [[Material Plane]].

- Plane's Purpose:
	The purpose of this elemental plane of Divinity is to be a realm of light, hope, and protection. It serves as a source of divine energy and a refuge for beings of goodness and faith. The plane is intrinsically linked to the gods and [[Harmonious Gods|benevolent deities]], acting as a conduit for their blessings and powers. Additionally, it serves as a sacred barrier against malevolent forces and a stronghold of resistance against corruption.

- Encounters in the Plane:
	Players may face challenges such as fallen or corrupted servants seeking to profane the divine light. They could encounter demonic beings or creatures of darkness attempting to invade the plane and weaken its sacred essence. Additionally, they may face tests of faith and morality, where divine light evaluates them to determine their true intentions.

- Plane Entry and Exit:
	Portals to the elemental plane of divine are found in sacred locations, in temples devoted to [[Harmonious Gods| benevolent deities or goddesses]] and in places of divine power. To close those portals one would need to desecrate these holy places and corrupt it, closing the connection between [[the planes]].

- Plane Hazards:
	Although it is a plane of light and goodness, the Divine plane is not without dangers. Players may encounter corrupted creatures or fallen servants seeking to pervert divine energy. Additionally, excessive exposure to divine light can be harmful to beings and creatures that ever showed hesitation to do righteous choises, making them vulnerable and causing extreme discomfort.

- Elemental Cities:
	In the Divine plane, there are few cities inhabited by godly beings and elementals, taking refuge in the plane. Although the plane is more an extension of the divine realms than a place with permanent settlements. However, players may find sacred sanctuaries, temples, and temporary refuges built for the performance of rituals and religious practices. These places are imbued with divine light and are used by godly beings as points of rest and protection before going back to work for the [[True Gods]].

- Elemental Landmarks:
	In the Divine plane, there are sacred landmarks representing significant milestones. They can be sources of intense divine light, such as towering pillars that stretch across the heavens or divine flowers that radiate celestial beauty. These landmarks are considered sacred and venerated by godly beings, serving as places of pilgrimage and worship.

- Elemental Landscapes:
	The landscapes of the Divine plane are characterized by an abundance of divine light. The air is filled with bright particles, creating an iridescent and sparkling mist. Vegetation is lush and vibrant, with flowers emitting radiance and trees that appear to be made of pure light. Floating rivers are composed of luminous water, while mountains are golden peaks that float through the sky. Each landscape exudes a sense of peace and serenity, reminding visitors of the divine presence everywhere.
