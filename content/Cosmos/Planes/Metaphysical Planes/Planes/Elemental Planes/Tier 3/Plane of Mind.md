# Mind | Mutable and Floating Landscapes That Change with the Emotions of Those Around Them Covered by Mists

- Elemental Theme:
	The primary elemental theme of the Mind plane is mental control and influence. This plane is intrinsically linked to the ability to manipulate minds, create illusions, and imbue inanimate objects with limited intelligence. Mental powers are predominant in this plane, allowing users to exert their dominion over the mental faculties of others.

- Plane Structure:
	The Mind plane has several distinct regions, each dedicated to different aspects of mental control. There are areas where illusions are more powerful and realistic, others where control over minds is stronger, and still others where inanimate objects come to life with limited intelligence. These regions interact with each other, allowing users to explore the various facets of mental control.

- Elemental Inhabitants:
	Inhabitants of this plane are beings who master the arts of mental control. They are masters of illusions, powerful telepaths, and creators of objects endowed with intelligence. Additionally, fantastic creatures linked to the mind, such as psychic entities and magical beings that feed on mental energy, can also be found in this plane.

- Elemental Manifestations:
	Elemental manifestations in the Mind plane are mainly illusory. Vivid and complex illusions permeate the environment, making it difficult to distinguish reality from fiction. Additionally, the plane may have areas where gravity is altered according to the will of the mental controller, creating a disorienting environment for visitors.

- Elemental Magic:
	In the Mind plane, elemental energies directly affect magic related to mental control. Users of this plane have a natural affinity for illusion, enchantment, and mental manipulation spells. They can cast more potent illusions and exercise more effective control over the minds of others. Moreover, they have the unique ability to imbue inanimate objects with a limited form of intelligence.

- Plane Attributes:
	In the Mind plane, reality is fluid and malleable. The laws of physics and logic can be distorted or ignored according to the will of mental controllers. Gravity can be manipulated, time may behave in a non-linear fashion, and landscapes can transform instantly in response to the thoughts of the inhabitants.

- Plane's Purpose:
	The purpose of the Mind plane is to explore the limits of mental control and influence. It is a realm where users can enhance their mental abilities, develop their mastery of illusions, and refine their ability to manipulate the minds of others. Additionally, the plane can serve as a refuge for those wishing to escape the material world and engage in mental experiments.

- Encounters in the Plane:
	When exploring the Mind plane, players may encounter other skilled mental controllers ready to test their abilities in mental confrontations. Additionally, they may come across hostile psychic creatures or illusory entities seeking to protect their domain. Valuable mental treasures, such as ancient knowledge and hidden secrets, can also be discovered.

- Plane Entry and Exit:
	Access to the Mind plane can be achieved through mental portals that require rituals and mental concentration to open. These portals may be hidden in places of great mental power or in locations where reality is thinner. Closing them may require disrupting the flow of mental energy or resolving complex mental challenges.

- Plane Hazards:
	The hazards of the Mind plane include deceptive illusions and mental manipulations that can confuse and drive unaware visitors insane. Those with strong mental defenses are harder to control but may also attract the attention of powerful beings seeking to dominate their minds. Additionally, the fluid and volatile nature of the plane itself can pose unpredictable risks.

- Elemental Cities:
	Within the Mind plane, there are cities that adapt to the elemental forces of the mind. These cities are built with architectural illusions, where buildings can change shape and color according to the inhabitants' will. Structures are designed to challenge perception and create an environment that stimulates mental power.

- Elemental Landmarks:
	Scattered throughout the Mind plane are significant mental landmarks. These points may be illusory monuments, complex mental labyrinths, or sacred sites where powerful mental entities reside. Each landmark has its own story and unique mental challenges for players to explore.

- Elemental Landscapes:
	Landscapes in the Mind plane are mutable and illusory while covered by a dense and infinite mist. Players may encounter living forests that change according to their thoughts, floating mountains created by pure imagination, and illusion lakes that reflect thoughts and memories. Each landscape is a manifestation of imagination and mental power that permeates the plane.
