# Invocation | A Blend of Locations from Other Planes with Portals Opening and Closing, Mixing Locations

- Elemental Theme:
	The primary elemental theme of this plane is Invocation. This plane is dedicated to the magic of summoning, allowing its inhabitants to call forth beings, objects, and even themselves from one place to another, whether near or far. Inhabitants of this plane have the ability to summon small objects and beings initially, and as they advance, they can summon powerful beings, teleport to different places, and even create dimensional portals.

- Plane Structure:
	The plane is structured as a mixture of different planes and locations, with multiple portals overlapping, closing and opening, causing distance to be always inconstant in the plane.

	There are areas where inhabitants specialize in summoning lesser beings, such magical familiars. Other regions are linked to the summoning of powerful entities, such as demons, angels, or elementals. There are also areas dedicated to the mastery of dimensional portals, allowing inhabitants to move rapidly from one place to another.

- Elemental Inhabitants:
	The elemental inhabitants of this plane are primarily beings with summoning abilities. Summoners, arcanists, and conjurers inhabit this plane, dedicated to mastering and enhancing their summoning skills. Additionally, there are magical creatures that are native to this plane and are linked to summoning, such as Invocation Elementals and Dimensional Guardians, powerful beings that protect passages between planes.

- Elemental Manifestations:
	Elemental manifestations in this plane are evidenced by the summonings and portals that occur in different areas. The environment around can transform and adapt when beings and objects are summoned, creating spatial distortions. These manifestations can be both benevolent and dangerous, depending on the control and intention of the summoners. The air can vibrate with magical energy, and the portals can shine brightly as they open and close.

- Elemental Magic:
	The energies of summoning in this plane deeply affect magic. Spells related to summoning are amplified and more powerful. Magic users have the ability to summon beings, objects, and even create portals more easily and accurately. Additionally, inhabitants can develop new spells and unique magical abilities, such as instant teleportation, summoning of powerful beings, and dimensional portal creation.

- Plane Attributes:
	In this plane, the laws of physics and distance are more flexible. Gravity can vary according to the invocation spells cast, allowing beings and objects to float or be pulled with intensity. Time can seem to distort when portals are opened, allowing inhabitants to move quickly between different locations. The boundaries between planes are also more tenuous in this plane, facilitating communication and interaction with other realms.

- Plane's Purpose:
	The purpose of this Elemental Plane of Invocation is to serve as a realm for those who wish to explore and master the magic of summoning. It is a place of study and practice for summoners and conjurers seeking to enhance their summoning skills and unravel the secrets of dimensional portals. Additionally, this plane acts as a point of connection and interaction with other planes, allowing inhabitants to travel quickly and establish magical connections with other realms.

- Encounters in the Plane:
	When exploring this Elemental Plane of Invocation, players may encounter challenges and encounters related to summoning magic. They may come across powerful summoners guarding ancient secrets or be summoned to confront uncontrolled creatures that have escaped their masters' control. Additionally, they may find magical artifacts and relics related to summoning that can enhance their own abilities.

- Plane Entry and Exit:
	The entries and exits of this elemental plane are found in random isolated regions of other planes. Exit portals can be found easily once inside the plane although each portal can lead to different destinations, depending on the knowledge and intentions of the summoners.

- Plane Hazards:
	Hazards in this plane are related to the reckless or uncontrolled use of summoning. Misguided summonings can result in hostile creatures or chaotic entities that threaten the plane's inhabitants. Additionally, the power of summoning can attract the attention of beings from other planes, leading to dangerous encounters or risky negotiations. Portals may close suddenly and slice anything caught in it, even necks. Players must be cautious when manipulating summoning to avoid unintended consequences.

- Elemental Cities:
	Cities in this plane are centers of study and practice of summoning. They are designed to enhance the skills of summoners and provide an environment conducive to mastery of summoning. Some cities are built around large portals that open to different destinations, allowing inhabitants to connect with other realms. Other cities have academies and libraries filled with knowledge about summoning.

- Elemental Landmarks:
	There are unique and significant landmarks scattered throughout the Elemental Plane of Invocation. Among them, there is the Great Stellar Portal, a massive portal that opens to a sky filled with twinkling stars, each representing a possible destination. There is also the Cave of Doors, a sacred location where summoners find an infinite labyrinth with walls covered in doors, each taking to different locations across the multiverse.

- Elemental Landscapes:
	The landscapes in this plane are influenced by summonings and portals that occur constantly. There are regions with floating islands suspended in the air, formed by powerful summonings. Other areas feature vibrant energy fields and streams of light, indicating the presence of recently opened portals. Additionally, there are enchanted forests with trees that move and create temporary portals when touched by summoners.
