# Transmutation | Disorienting Landscape with Mutating Orientations that Change with a Heartbeat-Like Wave

- Elemental Theme:
	The primary elemental theme of this plane is Transmutation. This plane is dedicated to the control and manipulation of the form and composition of objects. Inhabitants of this plane have the ability to alter the shape of simple objects, transmute substances, and perform powerful transmutation feats.

- Plane Structure:
	The plane is a chaotic landscape floating in an ever changing sky, all the things in this plane are constantly transforming in different things, objects in the plane also suddenly change as a heartbeat-like wave crosses the plane. The plane changes orientation suddenly as well, with the sky becoming the floor and long pathways crossing towards the sky and floating islands that become clouds and then cristalize into metal spheres, upsidedown tornadoes exist in the plane only to become crystal statues

	There are domains where objects constantly transform, changing their shape and composition unpredictably. Other regions are dominated by cities and settlements where inhabitants explore transmutation in a more controlled manner. These regions interact with each other, sharing transmutative knowledge and resources.

- Elemental Inhabitants:
	The elemental inhabitants of this plane are primarily Trnasmutation Elementals, beings capable of manipulating transmutation. Skilled alchemists, shapeshifters, and magical creatures related to transmutation are common in these lands. Additionally, beings seeking knowledge and mastery of transmutation are drawn to this plane, forming a society of scholars and explorers of the art of shape-shifting.

- Elemental Manifestations:
	Elemental manifestations in this plane are evidenced by the constant transformations of objects and the surrounding landscape. Simple objects can metamorphose, changing their shape and composition in surprising ways. Landscapes can alter, revealing new formations and transmuted structures. Storms of transmutative energy sweep through the sky, causing tactile illusions and momentary transformations.

- Elemental Magic:
	The transmutative energies of this plane have a significant impact on magic. Spells related to transmutation are amplified and more powerful. Magic users have the ability to change the shape and composition of objects more easily and precisely. Additionally, inhabitants can develop new spells and unique magical abilities, such as tactile illusions, metal transmutation, and the creation of magical substances.

- Plane Attributes:
	In this plane, the form and composition of objects are fluid and unstable. Gravity can be affected by transmutation, becoming chaotic and unreliable. Temperature can vary drastically, altering the substance of objects. Time flows similar to the [[material plane]], with some pockets where it can slow down or speed up.

- Plane's Purpose:
	The purpose of this Elemental Plane of Transmutation is to serve as a realm for those who seek control and mastery over the form and composition of objects. It is a source of raw transmutative knowledge and energy, where those who master the art of transmutation can find resources and challenges to enhance their skills. It connects and interacts with other planes, such as the [[Material Plane]] and other [[Elemental Planes|elemental planes]], allowing transmuters to influence reality in various realms.

- Encounters in the Plane:
	When exploring this Elemental Plane of Transmutation, players may encounter skilled alchemists who seek rare ingredients and perform bold experiments. They may also face powerful shapeshifters who challenge adventurers with their shape-shifting abilities. Additionally, there are fantastic creatures related to transmutation, such as transmuted homunculi, Transmutation Elementals and mutant animals. Valuable treasures, transmutative artifacts, and magical substances can be discovered along the journey.

- Plane Entry and Exit:
	Portals connecting the [[Material Plane]] to this Elemental Plane of Transmutation can be found in areas constantly touched by transmutation magic, such as the area surrounding powerful transmutative artifacts or the lair of powerful transmutation wizards. Users must perform specific transmutations and use transmutative items to open and close these portals. Closing a portal involves reversing the transmutation process used to open it.

- Plane Hazards:
	Hazards in this elemental plane include unstable transmuted objects that can pose unpredictable threats. Excessive manipulation of transmutative energies can cause distortions in the surrounding of the plane and trigger unintended side effects. Additionally, there are hostile creatures that seek to steal the secrets of transmutation or use their abilities for nefarious purposes.

- Elemental Cities:
	Cities within this Elemental Plane of Transmutation are centers of study and practice of the art of transmutation. They are designed to adapt to constant transformations, with flexible and movable structures. Some cities are built on shape-shifting mountainsides, while others float on transmuted floating islands. Each city has guilds of alchemists and shapeshifters, offering services, knowledge, and transmutative resources.

- Elemental Landmarks:
	There are unique and significant landmarks scattered throughout the Elemental Plane of Transmutation. Among them, there is an imposing tower known as the "Tower of Metamorphosis," where renowned shapeshifters gather to share knowledge and train their skills. There is also a sacred spring called the "Spring of Transformations," whose waters temporarily grant the power of transmutation to those who drink from it.

- Elemental Landscapes:
	The landscapes in this plane are fascinating and mutable. There are transmuted forests where trees constantly change their shape and appearance. Rolling plains where grass and rocks shift into hypnotic patterns. Crystal-transmuted caves that radiate bright and ever-changing colors. These landscapes offer unique challenges and rewards for adventurers who venture into them.
