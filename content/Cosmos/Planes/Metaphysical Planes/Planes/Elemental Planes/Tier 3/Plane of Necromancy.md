# Necromancy | An Endless Sea of Black Liquid with Colossal Corpses Floating

- Elemental Theme:
	The primary elemental theme of this plane is Necromancy. This plane is entirely dedicated to the control over decay, death, and the manipulation of necrotic energy. The essence of life is inverted and transformed into a dark force that governs this elemental plane.

- Plane Structure:
	The plane is entirely comprised of an endless sea of black liquid in an endless night, the only land in this plane are the corpses of huge gargantuan creatures, some humanoids and some not, that float on the water, although some are said to reach the bottom of such ocean, atop these corpses there are many distinct regions dedicated to different aspects of Necromancy. There are areas where death is more prevalent, filled with macabre cemeteries and desolate landscapes. Other regions are dominated by necropolises, where undead find their dwelling. These regions interact with each other in complex ways, with flows of necrotic energy connecting and feeding different domains.

- Elemental Inhabitants:
	The elemental inhabitants of this plane are mainly undead and necrotic beings. Skeletons, zombies, specters, and vampires are common in these lands. Additionally, skilled necromancers and powerful liches seek knowledge and power in this plane, honing their dark skills. Mostly Necromancy Elementals are known to roam the beneath and over the surface of the black necrotic liquid inbetween the giant corpses.

- Elemental Manifestations:
	Elemental manifestations in this plane are dark and sinister. Dark black clouds of mist and shadows envelop entire areas, creating an oppressive environment. In certain regions, the ground is constantly covered by a layer of necrotic mist that accelerates decomposition and decay. Twisted, leafless trees rise amidst the desolate landscape.

- Elemental Magic:
	The necrotic energies of this plane have a significant impact on magic. Spells related to necromancy are amplified and more potent. Necromancers can perform resurrection rituals and spells more easily and effectively, although corpses decay much faster than the [[Material plane]] as healing spells or spells that use the Life element become weaker or completely ineffective. Additionally, inhabitants of the plane can develop new spells and unique magical abilities, such as death curses, life-draining, and the summoning of undead.

- Plane Attributes:
	In this plane, gravity works more tenuously and unstably, allowing undead to possess surprising agility but making travessing the dark liquid in the oceans difficult, becoming strong in contact with it. The temperature is constantly cold and frigid, and time feels slow and sluggishly, and the plane is in constant nighttime.

- Plane's Purpose:
	The purpose of this Elemental Plane of Necromancy is to serve as a realm for those who seek power over death and decay. It is a source of raw necrotic energy, where those who master the dark arts of necromancy can find knowledge and resources to enhance their skills. It connects and interacts with other planes like the [[Shadowfell]], establishing a dark balance between life and death.

- Encounters in the Plane:
	When exploring the Elemental Plane of Necromancy, players may encounter undead creatures of all shapes and sizes. From wandering skeletons to powerful liches guarding hidden treasures in their dark fortresses. Factions of necromancers vie for control over territories, and powerful necrotic elemental guardians protect ancient secrets.

- Plane Entry and Exit:
	The portals connecting the [[Material Plane]] to this Elemental Plane of Necromancy are typically found in morgues, desecrated cemeteries and liches lairs. Closing these portals may require purification rituals or the destruction of necrotic energy.

- Plane Hazards:
	The dangers of this plane are many and varied. In addition to the countless undead and necrotic elementals that roam the plane, adventurers will face environmental hazards such as deadly black energy fields, pools of black liquid that drains life energy, and anti-healing areas that can neutralize any healing.

- Elemental Cities:
	The cities in this plane are dark and eerie, built with black and dark stones. Narrow, winding streets snake through decrepit structures. The cities are teeming with necromancers and their followers, who perform rituals and seek knowledge about death. Additionally, there are crypts and macabre tombs where the undead find refuge.

- Elemental Landmarks:
	There are unique and significant landmarks scattered throughout the Elemental Plane of Necromancy. Among them, there is an ancestral temple where an ancient lineage of liches rules and guards dark secrets. There is also a giant dead tree, whose roots stretch for miles, housing an underground labyrinth of catacombs infested with undead.

- Elemental Landscapes:
	The landscapes of this elemental plane are dark and macabre. Residing in different parts of the colossal corpses, there are dead and mist-shrouded forests, where twisted branches stretch like skeletal hands. Forgotten battlefields, where the lingering spirits of fallen warriors still wander. Black and treacherous mountains, filled with deep and dangerous caves where unknown horrors await unsuspecting adventurers.
