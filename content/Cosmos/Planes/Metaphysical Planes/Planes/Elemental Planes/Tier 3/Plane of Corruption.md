# Corruption | A Black and Red Terrain with a Dark Sky with Red Flares Showing Enigmatic Shadows

- Elemental Theme:
	The primary elemental theme of the Corruption plane is evil. This plane is primarily associated with corruption, the power of curses, and the breaking of divine blessings. Darkness manifests in various forms, representing the insidious influence of corruption.

- Plane Structure:
	The Corruption plane is a dark and desolate place marked by a barren blighted land of sharp rocks colored red and black, the air is permeated by a heavy and sinister atmosphere, the sky is covered in dark clouds that often glow with red light, as if something was suddenly lighting up behind them, when that happens mysterious shadows form in the clouds as if there was something behind them. There are some distinct regions dedicated to different ways of corruption. Corruption spreads throughout the plane, distorting the landscape and making it hostile in different ways.

- Elemental Inhabitants:
	Inhabitants of this plane are corrupted beings and creatures that embrace evil in any of itâ€™s forms. They are demonic beings, devils, fiends, and corrupt entities that seek to feed on the energy of corruption, often being regenerative to corrupt beings. Additionally, there are those who have been corrupted by the plane's curses, transforming into monstrous abominations.

- Elemental Manifestations:
	Elemental manifestations in the Corruption plane are dark and malevolent. There are areas of the plane shrouded in toxic and corrosive mist, where the air is thick and difficult to breathe. Blackened swamps and desolate terrains are common, where vegetation withers and decays. Waters are polluted and viscous, emanating negative energy.

- Elemental Magic:
	In the Corruption plane, the energies of corruption affect magic in distinct ways. Users of curses have an easier time casting spells related to corruption and curses. Additionally, they can enhance their powers by corrupting objects and beings around them, increasing their own strength.

- Plane Attributes:
	Gravity in the Corruption plane functions in a distorted manner, with areas where gravity is more intense or even inverted. The temperature is generally cold and gloomy, with occasional bursts of intense heat in the most corrupted areas. Time flows erratically, with periods of stagnation followed by rapid changes and turmoil.

- Plane's Purpose:
	The purpose of the Corruption plane is to be a place of challenge and conflict, where players confront the forces of darkness and fight against the spread of corruption. It is a realm of trial, where those strong enough can test their resilience against malevolent influence.

- Encounters in the Plane:
	When exploring the Corruption plane, players may encounter corrupted creatures and fiends thirsting for blood. They may face servants of darkness, cultists dedicated to spreading corruption, and powerful demons, devils and entities that seek to further their influence in the plane.

- Plane Entry and Exit:
	To access the Corruption plane, one must traverse enigmatic portals located in deeply corrupted areas or places of great suffering and despair. These portals require specific rituals and offerings of corrupt energy to be opened. Closing them may require the purification of the area or the destruction of sources of corruption.

- Plane Hazards:
	The hazards of the Corruption plane are many. Players must contend with the influence of corruption, which can weaken them and slowly erode their willpower. Additionally, there are magical and physical traps set by those who wish to protect or propagate corruption. The hostile environment, with toxic air and unstable terrain, also presents additional challenges.

- Elemental Cities:
	Within the Corruption plane, there are no thriving cities or flourishing civilizations. However, there are settlements inhabited by devils and corrupted beings, who live in the shadows and hide from other creatures trying to dominate them. These cities are built in dark and decadent ruins, adapting to the elemental forces of corruption.

- Elemental Landmarks:
	Scattered throughout the Corruption plane are dark and menacing landmarks. They can be abandoned temples, corrupted structures, or sites of ancient malevolent rituals. These landmarks are imbued with corrupted energy and can be sources of knowledge about corruption or places of power for players to explore.

- Elemental Landscapes:
	Landscapes in the Corruption plane are eerie and terrifying. Dark graveyards, rotting forests, and poisonous swamps are common, areas where corrupted plants digest the land spreading through kilometers. Twisted rocks and trees are found everywhere, revealing the corrosive influence of corruption. Landscapes are illuminated by dim and distorted light, creating an atmosphere of constant despair and desolation.
