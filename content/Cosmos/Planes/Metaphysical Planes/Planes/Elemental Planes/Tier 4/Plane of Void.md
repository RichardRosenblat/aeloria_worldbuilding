### Void | A Vast Emptiness Interrupted by Objects Drawn by Void Magic and Infinite Void Shrines Camouflaged in Darkness

- Elemental Theme:
	The primary elemental theme of the Void plane is Void. This plane is associated with spaces that are completely empty, devoid of anything or everything. The power of this element allows users to create true and absolute voids, manipulate nothingness, and nullify magical powers.

- Plane Structure:
	The plane's structure is characterized by vast regions of absolute void interspersed with domains of different manifestations of the void. Each domain has unique characteristics, such as deep and dark voids, void spaces with temporal distortions, or openings to other planes.

- Elemental Inhabitants:
	Inhabitants of this plane are creatures that master the power of the void. There are Voidshapers, native beings of the plane capable of shaping and manipulating the void with mastery. Additionally, Void Travelers are beings who can traverse dimensional voids and move between planes.

- Elemental Manifestations:
	In the Void plane, manifestations are represented by voids that expand and consume everything around them. There are areas in constant collapse, where the total absence of matter creates a dangerous and unstable environment. Additionally, there are temporal voids where time flows in strange and unpredictable ways.

- Elemental Magic:
	Magic in this plane is affected by the absolute void. Users of the void have the ability to nullify spells and magical abilities, rendering them ineffective. Furthermore, they can create voids that consume spells cast against them, absorbing their energy and neutralizing their effects.

- Plane Attributes:
	In the Void plane, the total absence of matter creates a unique environment. Gravity functions differently, with areas of zero gravity floating in the void. Temperatures are extreme, ranging from absolute cold to intense heat. Time flows differently compared to the [[Material Plane]], sometimes accelerated and other times decelerated.
	
	**Negative-Dominant:** In the plane, negativity held sway in two distinct degrees. The areas influenced by minor negative forces experienced a noticeable diminishment in healing capabilities, fostering an atmosphere of decay and desolation. A blacksmith's forge flickered dimly, the dull thud of his hammer echoed in a lifeless void, and colors faded into muted shades. Those subjected to a major negative influence found themselves engulfed in darkness, where healing became near impossibleâ€”an agonizingly slow process that drained visitors of not only their health but also their strength and abilities. Languishing in despair, travelers faced a relentless assault on their vitality, crumbling under the weight of the pervasive malevolence. On a major negative-dominant area, only a potent negative energy ward could shield a traveler from this insidious life-draining force.

- Plane's Purpose:
	The purpose of this Void elemental plane is to balance the forces of the other elements. It acts as a counterpoint, a necessary absence in a multiverse filled with elemental energy. It also serves as a training realm for those who wish to master the power of the void.

- Encounters in the Plane:
	When exploring this plane, players may encounter challenges such as unstable voids that threaten to consume them, powerful creatures that control the void and seek to dominate them, and beings who seek to use the power of the void for nefarious purposes. Rare void-related treasures can be found, such as amulets that allow the temporary creation of small voids.

- Plane Entry and Exit:
	Entrances and exits to the Void plane are portals that open in empty spaces. To access the plane, specific rituals must be performed, or special artifacts may be needed to open these portals. Closing the portals requires a deep understanding of the void and its manipulation.

- Plane Hazards:
	Hazards in this plane include the risk of being consumed by the absolute void, environmental challenges like collapsing voids, and unpredictable temporal distortions. Navigating the Void plane requires constant care, as one wrong step could lead to total annihilation.

- Elemental Cities:
	In the Void plane, there are no cities in the traditional sense. However, Voidshapers can create temporary structures in the void, where they gather to share knowledge and train their powers.

- Elemental Landmarks:
	Scattered throughout the Void plane are unique landmarks that defy comprehension. These landmarks include immense void spaces that seem to stretch infinitely, crystalline formations of void energy, and floating towers that defy gravity. Each landmark holds secrets and mysteries related to the power of the void.

- Elemental Landscapes:
	Landscapes in the Void plane are characterized by a vast, black void interrupted only by smaller voids and manifestations of the void. There are areas where temporal distortions create ever-changing landscapes and others where the complete absence of gravity allows objects to float in the void. These landscapes offer a challenging and fascinating environment for adventurers to explore.
