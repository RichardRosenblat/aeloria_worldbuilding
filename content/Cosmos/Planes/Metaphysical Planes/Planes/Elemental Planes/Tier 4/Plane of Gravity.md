### Gravity | A Breathable Miniature Cosmos with Planets and Black Holes

- Elemental Theme:
	The primary elemental theme of the Gravity plane is Gravity. In this plane, manipulation of gravitational forces is the central element, allowing its inhabitants to control and alter gravity around them.

- Plane Structure:
	The Gravity plane is a scaled-down representation of the cosmos, with an infinite [[solar system]] composed of planets, asteroids, and other celestial bodies. However, the highlight of this plane is the "gravitational wells," areas where gravity constantly changes. These wells can create unusual gravitational effects and challenges for adventurers. Moreover, in outer space, the air is breathable, and adventurers can alter gravity around them to fly freely.

- Elemental Inhabitants:
	Inhabitants of this plane are beings capable of manipulating gravity and adapting to the different gravitational levels of the wells. Among the inhabitants are Graviturgists, mages specializing in gravitational manipulation, and the Asterites, a species of beings living on floating asteroids. Additionally, other fantastic creatures inhabit this plane, such as the Stellar Beings, radiant beings that gracefully move among the stars.

- Elemental Manifestations:
	Elemental manifestations in the Gravity plane are exemplified by the ever-changing gravitational wells. These wells can alter gravity in a specific area, causing adventurers to walk on walls, leap great distances, or experience the sensation of flying in zero-gravity areas. Additionally, the plane features an imposing central black hole, whose accretion disk illuminates the entire plane.

- Elemental Magic:
	Gravitational energies directly affect magic in this plane. Graviturgists have access to spells and magical abilities related to gravity, such as creating intense gravitational fields, altering gravity in larger areas, and levitating heavy objects. Furthermore, flight and levitation spells are particularly potent in this plane, allowing practitioners to easily navigate gravitational wells and outer space.

- Plane Attributes:
	In the Gravity plane, gravity functions fluidly and constantly changes. The intensity of gravity can vary from one well to another, offering a unique experience in each area. Outer space is habitable, with breathable air, and allows for free flight. Planets can vary in size, from small and easily traversed to giant ones comparable to real planets. The presence of the central black hole adds an element of mystery and beauty to the plane.

- Plane's Purpose:
	The purpose of the Gravity plane is to provide adventurers with the opportunity to explore the wonders of gravity and the cosmos. It is a realm of space exploration, where inhabitants can master gravity and navigate different regions with unique gravitational characteristics. Additionally, the plane also serves as a source of knowledge about gravitational forces and their role in the multiverse.

- Encounters in the Plane:
	When exploring the Gravity plane, players may face challenges such as traversing treacherous gravitational wells, battling foes who master gravity, and dealing with the peculiarities of outer space. There are hostile factions, such as the Gravity Devourers, who seek to control the gravitational wells and use their power for nefarious purposes. Gravity-related treasures and artifacts can be found, such as Gravitational Amulets and Scrolls of the Stars, which grant special abilities to adventurers.

- Plane Entry and Exit:
	Portals to the Gravity plane are located in specific locations in the various worlds of the [[Material Plane]]. To access these portals, adventurers must use an artifact called the Astral Key, which allows the opening of a gravitational portal. Closing these portals requires the proper use of the Astral Key to reverse the opening process.

- Plane Hazards:
	Hazards in the Gravity plane are associated with intense gravitational variations. Adventurers may find themselves trapped in gravitational wells with extreme gravity, which can cause damage and hinder movement. Additionally, outer space can also pose dangers, such as cosmic radiation and encounters with hostile alien creatures.

- Elemental Cities:
	Within the Gravity plane, there are cities and settlements adapted to gravitational forces. Floating cities are built on asteroids and have gravitational control systems to maintain stability. Buildings and structures are designed considering the influence of gravity, with suspended platforms and pathways that adapt to gravitational changes.

- Elemental Landmarks:
	Landmarks in the Gravity plane include celestial and astronomical landmarks, such as living constellations and bright [[Astronomical objects|nebulas]]. Additionally, there are special locations, such as the "Gravitational Vale," a region where multiple gravitational wells converge, creating complex and challenging gravitational effects.

- Elemental Landscapes:
	Landscapes in the Gravity plane are diverse and fascinating. They range from open fields of floating asteroids to planetary landscapes with stunning vistas. Each elemental landscape has unique features related to gravity, such as hills that defy gravity, floating mountains, and canyons where gravity seems nonexistent. The imposing presence of the central black hole, with its brilliant accretion disk, adds a touch of grandeur to the plane.
