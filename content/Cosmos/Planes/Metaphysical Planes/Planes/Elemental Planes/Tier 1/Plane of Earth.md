# Earth | Eternal Mountains

- Elemental Theme:
	Earth is the central element of this elemental plane, where soil, crystals, non-metallic minerals, sand, and their variants play a fundamental role. The elemental powers of this plane are associated with the manipulation of earth and its properties.

- Plane Structure:
	The elemental plane of Earth is one singular and infinite mountain structured into different regions and domains that represent distinct aspects of this element. There are vast expanses of caves with grassy plains, deep caverns, and expansive deserts created from sand moving inside different chambers. These regions interact with each other through underground pathways and lava rivers, creating a complex and interconnected ecosystem.

- Elemental Inhabitants:
	Native elemental creatures of this plane include powerful earth elementals, such as stone giants, earth golems, and beings made of living crystals. Additionally, the dao, powerful earth genies inhabit this plane. Other fantastic creatures, such as earth dragons, trolls, and stone lycanthropes, can also be found here.

- Elemental Manifestations:
	In the elemental plane of Earth, one can witness powerful earthquakes, where the earth itself trembles under the influence of elemental powers. Rocks crack, chasms open, and mountain-sized stones rise in response to earth manipulation by the plane's inhabitants. There are also imposing crystalline formations, underground caves filled with precious minerals, and constantly shifting sand dunes. These manifestations affect both the environment and the inhabitants, shaping the landscape over time.

- Elemental Magic:
	Earth's elemental energies permeate magic in this plane. Spells related to the earth, such as rock conjuration, skin hardening, and terramancy, are more potent and effective here. Additionally, inhabitants of the plane have access to unique magical abilities, such as the ability to merge with the earth, create animated stone golems, and channel the strength of minerals to enhance their abilities.

- Plane Attributes:
	In this plane, gravity functions similarly to the [[Material Plane]], but there is a constant sense of solidity and stability. The environment is characterized by extreme temperature variations, from intense heat in regions near volcanoes to piercing cold in mountainous areas. Time flows similarly to the [[Material Plane]].

- Plane's Purpose:
	The elemental plane of Earth plays the role of an elemental balance realm. It is a place where the forces of the earth and its corresponding elements are preserved and kept in harmony. It is connected to other planes through specific portals that lead to places where the earth is a central part of existence, such as deep mines, mystical caves, and even subterranean realms.

- Encounters in the Plane:
	When exploring the elemental plane of Earth, players may face challenges such as powerful stone giants protecting their territory, imposing earth golems guarding ancient secrets, and hostile subterranean creatures. Precious treasures like rare gems and magical minerals can be found in the depths of the plane, while ancient artifacts and terramancy tools may be discovered in places of power.

- Plane Entry and Exit:
	Portals connecting the [[Material Plane]] to the elemental plane of Earth are found in mountains, deserts or deep inside caves. Magical items such as earth amulets or connection runes may also be required to access or close these portals. The plane also is connected to the [[Plane of Water]] and to the [[Plane of Fire]], creating regions considered the subplanes of volcanos and mud respectively.

- Plane Hazards:
	Inherent dangers in the elemental plane of Earth include scorching lava flows, devastating earthquakes, and dust storms that obscure vision. Players will need to navigate carefully and use their earth-based skills and magic to overcome these challenges.

- Elemental Cities:
	Within the elemental plane of Earth, there are unique cities that have adapted to the elemental forces around them. Examples include a magma-based city built inside an volcano, where buildings are made of molten stone; an underground city carved into the depths of the mountain with intercate detailed buildings made of rare minerals, illuminated by luminous crystals; and a city built high on towering stone cliffs, with suspended platforms and complex networks for movement.

- Elemental Landmarks:
	Unique and significant landmarks scattered throughout the elemental plane of Earth include sacred caves where elemental sages gather to channel the earth's energy, giant crystal formations emanating magical power, and ancient forests of stone trees with millennia-old knowledge. These landmarks may contain secrets, challenges, and rewards for adventurers to explore and discover.

- Elemental Landscapes:
	The distinct and fascinating landscapes of the elemental plane of Earth are varied and stunning. From scorching volcanic mountains where lava and ashes are expelled, players will encounter a unique and challenging atmosphere. There are also caverns covered in crystalline structures growing on the walls, and eternal rock cliffs. Each of these elemental landscapes offers unique challenges and wonders for adventurers to explore.
