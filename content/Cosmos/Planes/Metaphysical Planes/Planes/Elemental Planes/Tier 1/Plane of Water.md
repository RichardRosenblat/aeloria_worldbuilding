# Water | Infinite Ocean

- Elemental Theme:
	Water is the central element of the elemental plane. Its characteristics and manifestations are primarily associated with water and moisture. In this plane, water is revered as a vital and primordial force.

- Plane Structure:
	The elemental plane of water consists of an infinite ocean, and small floating islands with serene lakes, winding rivers, and even clouds laden with moisture. There are distinct regions dedicated to different forms of water, from the ocean depths to coastal estuaries and mangroves. These regions interact with each other through ocean currents and rivers that flow from one area to another.

- Elemental Inhabitants:
	In this plane, a variety of water-associated elemental creatures dwell. Water elementals are the native beings of the plane, possessing fluid forms and an intimate connection with bodies of water. Additionally, creatures like marids, mermaids, tritons, and krakens also make this plane their home.

- Elemental Manifestations:
	Elemental manifestations of water are abundant in this plane. Furious sea storms can occur, bringing massive waves and intense rainfall. Floating islands formed by corals and shells can be found in certain areas, allowing travelers to walk on the surface of the sea. Furthermore, water can assume solid or gaseous forms, creating fluid and ever-changing landscapes.

- Elemental Magic:
	Water-related magic in this plane is amplified. Spells involving water manipulation are more potent and effective, enabling spellcasters to control large quantities of water and create destructive waves or dense mists. Additionally, inhabitants there have unique spells that allow targets to breathe underwater.

- Plane Attributes:
	In the elemental plane of water, gravity functions similarly to the [[Material Plane]], but with less resistance to movement in water. Temperatures are generally milder and humid, varying according to proximity to bodies of water. Time flows slightly slower compared to the [[Material Plane]], giving a sense of calm and tranquility.

- Plane's Purpose:
	This elemental plane of water plays a crucial role in the balance of the multiverse. It is a source of vital elemental energy, powering rivers, seas, and life itself. Moreover, it connects and interacts with other planes, influencing the climate and hydrology of different realms.

- Encounters in the Plane:
	When exploring the elemental plane of water, players may encounter hostile triton factions, powerful elemental guardians, and formidable marine creatures such as sea giants and leviathans. Submerged treasures, water-related magical artifacts, and rare resources like enchanted pearls and corals can be found in this plane.

- Plane Entry and Exit:
	Portals or passages connecting the [[Material Plane]] to this elemental plane of water can be accessed in large bodies of water, such as in the origin of a intense underwater current or an artifact from an ancient submerged temple. The plane lso has connections to the [[Plane of Air]] and to the [[Plane of Earth]], creating domains considered subplanes of ice and ooze respectively.

- Plane Hazards:
	Significant environmental hazards exist in this plane, including violent ocean currents, predatory marine creatures, and extreme pressures at great depths. Tropical storms can arise suddenly, posing challenges to navigation and the survival of travelers. Players will need aquatic skills and resilience to face these challenges.

- Elemental Cities:
	Within the elemental plane of water, unique cities adapt to the elemental forces around them. Some cities are located in the depths of the oceans, built with magical crystals that emit soft light and exhibit graceful architecture. Others are built in coral reefs ornamented by thousands of pearls.

- Elemental Landmarks:
	Significant landmarks scattered throughout the elemental plane of water include the Primordial Springs, which are sacred springs radiating elemental energy. There is also an ancient underwater labyrinth with strong currents travelling in corridors carved in coral and living statues guarding long-lost secrets. Additionally, a giant rainbow stretching across an infinite ocean is a mystical landmark and a source of legends.

- Elemental Landscapes:
	The distinct and fascinating landscapes of the elemental plane of water are formed by vast infinite oceans, tempestuous seas, foggy swamps, giant waterfalls, and floating algae forests. Players can venture into vibrant coral reefs, explore ancient submerged cities, or climb underwater hills covered with exotic aquatic plants. Each of these landscapes offers a unique environment filled with challenges and wonders to be discovered.
