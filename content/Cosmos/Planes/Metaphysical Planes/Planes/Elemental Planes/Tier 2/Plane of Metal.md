Additionally, inhabitants can develop new spells and unique magical abilities involving metal manipulation.

- Plane Attributes:
	In this elemental plane of Metal, gravity functions similarly to the [[Material Plane]]. However, there is a more intense presence of static electricity, causing metallic objects to be attracted to each other, at the areas between blades of the plane, the gravity grows stronger, plummeting down creatures that find themselves in those spaces. Extreme temperature variations are common, with areas ranging from extremely cold to extremely hot. Time flows at a different pace compared to the [[Material Plane]], passing slightly slower.

- Plane's Purpose:

Valuable treasures, such as legendary weapons and armor made from rare metals, can be found in this plane. Additionally, magical artifacts with unique properties related to metals are common.

- Plane Entry and Exit:
	There are access portals to the [[Material Plane]] that require specific rituals involving precious metals and arcane symbols related to them. These portals can be found in specific locations, such as deep mines or ancient forges. To close these portals, sacred metals must be gathered and a powerful ritual performed.
