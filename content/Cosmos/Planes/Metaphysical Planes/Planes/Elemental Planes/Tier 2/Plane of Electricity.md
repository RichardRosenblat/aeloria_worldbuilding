# Electricity | Deafening Storm

- Elemental Theme:
	The primary elemental theme of this plane is Electricity. It is a plane dedicated to the control of storms, thunders, electricity and its currents. The inhabitants of this plane possess abilities to create electric sparks, control lightning, generate electric fields, and unleash powerful electric bolts.

- Plane Structure:
	The plane is composed an eternal storm with howling winds and constant thunders and lightnings, often huge rocks and structures can be seen being taken by the winds. There are areas with subtler and controlled electric discharges, where the storm is calmer and electric fields are used for illumination and power generation. There are also regions where the electric storms is more violent, where powerful lightning streaks across the sky, and intense electric currents run through the terrain.

- Elemental Inhabitants:
	The native inhabitants of this plane are Electricity Elementalists, beings capable of creating and controlling electricity. They can be humanoid with the ability to generate electric bolts or elemental creatures of electricity, made of pure electric energy. Additionally, some creatures adapted to electrified environments, such as beings resistant to electric shocks, also call this plane home.

- Elemental Manifestations:
	Unique manifestations of electric forces occur throughout the plane. Where constant electric storms with lightning that illuminates the sky and electric currents that run across the sky. Rocky islands can be dotted with luminous trees that emit electricity, creating a vibrant and electrically charged atmosphere. These manifestations affect the environment and its inhabitants, offering challenges and opportunities for those who explore the plane.

- Elemental Magic:
	The elemental energies of Electricity influence magic in this plane. Spells related to electricity are more potent and effective here. Magic users can channel and amplify electric energy in their spells, causing additional damage and manipulating electric fields around them. Additionally, inhabitants develop new spells and unique magical abilities involving electricity.

- Plane Attributes:
	In this elemental plane of Electricity, gravity functions similarly to the [[Material Plane]]. However, the constant presence of electricity and high winds creates a highly electrically charged and chaotic environment. Travelers need to take additional precautions to avoid electric shocks. Extreme temperature variations are common, with electrified areas being hotter and regions where electricity is more subtle and colder. Time flows similar to the [[Material Plane]];

- Plane's Purpose:
	The purpose of this elemental plane of Electricity is to be a source of powerful and uncontrollable electric energy. It also serves as a testing ground for adventurers, requiring skills in control and protection against electric shocks.

- Encounters in the Plane:
	Challenges in this elemental plane include facing powerful Electricity Elementalists guarding the secrets of electric manipulation. Intense electric storms may also occur, where powerful lightning and thunders threatens travelers. Treasures and resources found in this plane may include conductive electric crystals, artifacts that grant control over electricity, and magical items that amplify electric powers.

- Plane Entry and Exit:
	There are portals that connect the [[Material Plane]] to this elemental plane of Electricity. To activate them, specific rituals involving the use of electricity are required. This may involve the presence of certain electricity-conductive items or the use of specific electric spells. The portals can be found in locations with high concentrations of electric energy, for example great lightning storms, underground areas with electrically charged crystals and lost ancient artificers workshops.

- Plane Hazards:
	Hazards in this elemental plane include the constant threat of electric shocks. Unprotected travelers may be targets of electric discharges and dangerous currents. Additionally, intense electric storms can pose a significant risk to adventurers. Those who wish to explore this plane must be prepared with adequate insulation and protection against electricity.

- Elemental Cities:
	Cities within the elemental plane of Electricity are designed to deal with the electric forces around them. They may be constructed with conductive materials and have protection systems against electric shocks. Cities may be illuminated by electric fields that provide power for lighting and other needs. The inhabitants of these cities are skilled in the manipulation and control of electricity.

- Elemental Landmarks:
	Scattered throughout the elemental plane of Electricity, you can find unique and significant landmarks soaring through the chaotic storm. This could include imposing electricity towers, where giant electric currents dance and emanate energy. Another example could be areas with electric dungeons, whose corridors glow with electricity and create a complex network of electric charges. Each landmark has its own story and challenges associated with it.

- Elemental Landscapes:
	The distinct and fascinating landscapes present in the elemental plane of Electricity are formed by the electric forces that permeate it. There are areas with large electric currents floating in the air, creating treacherous terrain where bridges and passages can be sources of shocks. The storm emits constant flashes and lightning, providing a dynamic and impressive landscape. There are also areas within the storm where electricity is more subtle, creating an atmosphere of calm and balance between electric power and the surrounding nature.
