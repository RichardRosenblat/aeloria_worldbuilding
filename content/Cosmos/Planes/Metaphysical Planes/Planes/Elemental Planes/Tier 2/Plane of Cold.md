# Cold | Eternal Glacier

- Elemental Theme:
	The primary elemental theme of this plane is Cold. The plane is characterized by the dominant presence of the cold element, with its unique characteristics and influences.

- Plane Structure:
	The Cold plane is an eternal glacier with distinct regions dedicated to different aspects of the element. There are vast areas covered in snow, ice mountains with snowy peaks, and extensive frigid forests. These regions interact with each other through frozen pathways, ice caves, and icy wind currents that traverse the plane, connecting the various domains.

- Elemental Inhabitants:
	Native elemental creatures of this plane include Ice Elementals, snow golems, frost lindwurms and beings made of pure cold energy. Additionally, other fantastical creatures such as yetis, ice fairies, and creatures adapted to the cold make this plane their home. These beings are attuned to the cold and possess abilities related to it.

- Elemental Manifestations:
	Unique manifestations of the cold element in the plane include intense snowstorms, cutting glacial winds, slowly moving glaciers, and unstable ice fields. These manifestations affect the environment and its inhabitants, creating additional challenges for explorers. The climate is constantly cold, and snow and ice are present in all landscapes.

- Elemental Magic:
	The elemental energies of cold affect magic in this plane in specific ways. Ice and cold-related spells are more potent and effective, while fire-related spells may be weakened or even nullified. The inhabitants of this plane have developed unique magical abilities related to cold, such as summoning snowstorms, creating ice shields, and freezing objects with a touch.

- Plane Attributes:
	Specific planar characteristics associated with the Cold elemental plane include extremely low temperatures, with even more intense variations in different regions. Gravity functions normally, but the intense cold can affect the resilience and mobility of adventurers. Time flows slowly and deliberately in this plane, creating a sense of calm and stillness, with the day and night cycle lasting many weeks.

- Plane's Purpose:
	The purpose of the Cold elemental plane in the multiverse is to serve as a source of cold and frozen energy. It is a realm of elemental balance, providing a counterpoint to the element of heat and fire. The plane is connected to other planes related to ice and cold, and its balance is essential for the stability of the multiverse.

- Encounters in the Plane:
	Challenges in this elemental plane of Cold include encounters with elemental guardians of ice and cold, powerful creatures that protect the secrets and harmony of the plane. There are also environmental hazards such as avalanches, snowstorms, and the risk of hypothermia. Treasures and resources in this plane may include magical items made of enchanted ice, crystalline gems that radiate intense cold, and cold-adapted plants with healing properties.

- Plane Entry and Exit:
	There are specific portals and passages that connect the [[Material Plane]] to the elemental plane of Cold. These portals can be found in snowy peaks of mountains, inside frozen glaciers or in depts of frozen oceans. Closing these portals requires changing the temperature of the area or using specific items that reverse the flow of cold energy.

- Plane Hazards:
	Inherent dangers present in the elemental plane of Cold include extreme temperatures that can cause hypothermia or freezing, cutting winds that can cause physical harm, and the constant presence of slippery ice, making navigation dangerous. Players can navigate and overcome these challenges by using appropriate clothing and equipment, magical cold resistance abilities, and careful strategies to avoid hazardous areas.

- Elemental Cities:
	Within the elemental plane of Cold, there are unique cities and settlements adapted to the elemental forces around them. These cities may be built in underground ice caverns, with structures made of crystalline glass. Other cities may be constructed on icy mountains, with architecture that harnesses ice and snow to create a natural defense against invaders.

- Elemental Landmarks:
	While exploring the elemental plane of Cold, players will encounter unique and significant landmarks scattered throughout the plane. This could include impressive ice formations, such as ice cathedrals with bright stained glass, forests of ice trees that glow with ethereal blue light, and ancient ruins buried under layers of snow and ice. Each landmark has its own story, magical properties, or associated quest, offering players memorable and worthy exploration sites.

- Elemental Landscapes:
	The elemental plane of Cold has distinct and fascinating landscapes formed by the elements of ice and cold. These landscapes include vast frozen tundras with endless snowfields and rolling hills covered in ice. There are also icy mountains with snowy peaks that extend into the clouds, creating a majestic and treacherous landscape. Glacial valleys are filled with frozen rivers and ice caves, while frigid forests feature trees adorned with shimmering ice crystals. Each landscape offers a unique atmosphere, with challenges and wonders for adventurers to explore.
