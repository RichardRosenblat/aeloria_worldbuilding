> [!Todo] There is still much to do
> This file is unfinished, i need to Revisit this to add the overloading capacities of the positive energy and say it contacts the [[plane of life]] as well, sharing some of it's energies and effects and saying it contacts the [[Feywild]]
# Energy | Towers of Unbridled Light with Platformed Scenarios

- Elemental Theme:
	The primary elemental theme of this plane is Energy. In this elemental plane, pure energy is the central element, controlling constructs of pure magic that emit intense light. The inhabitants and features of this plane are intrinsically tied to this luminous energy.

- Plane Structure:
	The Energy elemental plane is structured by eternally tall towers of unbridled light with enormous platforms surrounding them where many regions can be found. There are no distinct regions dedicated to specific elements, but rather a constant interaction of luminous energies throughout the plane. Different areas of this plane show variations in light intensity and color, creating an ever-shifting landscape.

- Elemental Inhabitants:
	In the Energy elemental plane, the inhabitants are beings with an affinity for light and energy magic. In addition to the energy constructs themselves, there are native creatures of the plane made of pure energy, such as the Luminals. These creatures have translucent bodies that radiate intense light.

- Elemental Manifestations:
	The manifestations of energy in this plane are awe-inspiring. Explosions of intense light, brilliant constructs, and beams of luminous energy streak across the skies. The environment is filled with floating islands formed of concentrated energy that surround the main pillars of the plane. These manifestations affect the environment and its inhabitants, creating a vibrant and radiant atmosphere.

- Elemental Magic:
	The elemental energy of this plane directly influences magic. Spellcasters venturing into this plane can channel luminous energy more effectively. Spells involving light, illumination, and magical energy are more potent in this plane. Additionally, inhabitants can develop new spells that involve manipulating light constructs and amplifying energy. Any other magic in this plane is overloaded, often making spells uncontrollable and unpredictable, changing directions and becoming stronger suddenly

- Plane Attributes:
	In the Energy elemental plane, gravity functions similarly to the [[Material Plane]], although certain platforms around the main pillars of the plane may present gravity in a different orientation. However, time flows differently, with hours of the day passing rapidly. The temperature is comfortable, neither excessively hot nor cold. The main characteristic of this plane is intense luminosity and the altering of spells cast within it.
	**Positive-Dominant**: There are two degrees of positive energy influence in the plane. areas with a minor positive influence were abundant with life and energy, amplifying physical processes and boosting healing. A blacksmith's fire burned hotter, the ring of his hammer was louder, and every color shone with intensity. Those with a major influence were blindingly bright and healing was very rapid. Visitors quickly swelled with health and eventually the vitality of the plane overwhelmed their constitution and they literally exploded with energy.

- Plane's Purpose:
	The purpose of this Energy elemental plane in the multiverse is to serve as a source of pure arcane energy. It acts as a reservoir of arcane power and as a realm where magic practitioners can enhance their understand of light and energy. Additionally, the plane is connected to other planes through portals that allow the flow of elemental energy to different parts of the multiverse.

- Encounters in the Plane:
	When exploring this elemental plane, players may face challenges such as powerful elemental guardians that protect points of concentrated energy. There are also hostile factions that wish to control elemental energy for their own purposes. Magical treasures related to light and energy can be found, such as mystical crystals that channel arcane power or artifacts that amplify light magic.

- Plane Entry and Exit:
	Portals connecting the [[Material Plane]] to this Energy elemental plane can be found in places where magic energy is overloaded, antique layers of powerful wizards, areas constantly illuminated by magical effects. Some special items, like crystals charged with luminous energy, may be needed to activate the portals.

- Plane Hazards:
	Hazards in this elemental plane include uncontrolled energy explosions that can harm adventurers. Additionally, there are areas with extreme light intensities that can temporarily blind or burn those who are unaccustomed. Players may also face hostile energy beings or be exposed to excessive concentrations of energy that can overwhelm their magical abilities.

- Elemental Cities:
	Within the Energy elemental plane, there are unique cities adapted to the elemental forces of light and energy. These cities are built with translucent and iridescent materials, emitting a constant radiance. Tall towers sculpted from luminous crystals serve as centers for learning and practicing magic. The inhabitants of these cities have a natural affinity for light and energy, using them to illuminate their homes and provide power for their daily needs.

- Elemental Landmarks:
	Scattered throughout the Energy elemental plane, there are unique and significant landmarks. For example, there is a gigantic iridescent crystalline formation that emits a bright and dazzling light. There are also groves of luminous trees whose leaves glow in various colors. These locations possess special magical properties, such as the ability to revitalize and amplify light magic.

- Elemental Landscapes:
	The landscapes of the Energy elemental plane are filled with luminous splendor among the eternal columns. From radiant meadows covered in bioluminescent flowers to radiant valleys where energy rivers flow, each location has a unique and dazzling atmosphere. Dramatic towers of bright energy rise against a sky filled with energy streams and clouds. Underground caverns emit a soft and mesmerizing light. These enchanting landscapes offer adventurers a visually fascinating and challenging experience.
