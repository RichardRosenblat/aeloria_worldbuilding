# Acid | An Infinite Swamp

- Elemental Theme:
	The primary elemental theme of this plane is Acid. It is primarily associated with the control of acids and corrosion with varying degrees and effects. The inhabitants of this plane possess abilities to create and manipulate acid, causing corrosive damage and creating destructive effects.

- Plane Structure:
	The plane an infinite swamp with blighted trees and a green sky that gives place to distant mountains that has distinct regions dedicated to different types of acids and corrosion. There are areas with weaker acids, where corrosion is mild and controlled, and regions with extremely corrosive acids, where destruction is intense. These regions interact with each other through rivers and lakes of acid, forming hazardous and unpredictable landscapes.

- Elemental Inhabitants:
	The native inhabitants of this plane are Acid Elementalists, beings capable of manipulating and controlling acids in various forms along with oozes and slimes. There are also specific acid elemental creatures, such as Acid Elementals, formed from the very elemental essence of acid. Additionally, some creatures adapted to corrosive environments, such as acid-resistant beings, also call this plane home.

- Elemental Manifestations:
	Unique manifestations of acid forces occur throughout the plane. There can be intense acid rains, geysers that shower areas in corrosive ooze, creating corrosive puddles and wearing down the environment. Landscapes can be marked by corrosive craters and accelerated erosion. These manifestations affect the environment and its inhabitants, offering challenges and opportunities for those who explore the plane.

- Elemental Magic:
	The elemental energies of Acid influence magic in this plane. Spells related to acids are more potent and effective here. Magic users can channel corrosion and the destructive effects of acid into their spells, causing additional damage and corroding the magical resistance of targets. Additionally, Inhabitants there can develop new spells and unique magical abilities involving acid manipulation.

- Plane Attributes:
	In this elemental plane of Acid, gravity functions similarly to the [[Material Plane]]. However, there is a regular presence of acid mist in the air, requiring travelers to take additional precautions to avoid corrosive damage. Extreme temperature variations are common, with areas ranging from extremely acidic and hot to less acidic and cold. Time flows at a different pace compared to the [[Material Plane]], sometimes accelerating or decelerating depending on areas of the plane where acid has different viscosity.

- Plane's Purpose:
	The purpose of this elemental plane of Acid is to be a source of corrosive and destructive power. It also serves as a testing ground for the resilience and survival skills of adventurers. Additionally, this plane interacts with other planes, corroding and wearing down their barriers and defenses.

- Encounters in the Plane:
	When exploring this elemental plane of Acid, players may face challenges such as hostile acid creatures, such as beings made of living acid or animals adapted to corrosion. Factions of acid elementalists may oppose intruders, protecting their domain. Valuable treasures and resources related to acid, such as corrosive potions and corrosion-resistant metals, can be found in this plane.

- Plane Entry and Exit:
	There are access portals to the [[Material Plane]] that require specific rituals and the presence of corrosive acids to activate them. These portals may be located in strategic locations, such as deep acid caves or pools of concentrated acid. To close these portals, the associated corrosive acids must be neutralized or removed.

- Plane Hazards:
	Environmental hazards in this plane include intense acid rains that corrode everything they touch, corrosive acid puddles, and acid vapors that can burn the skin and lungs. Players will need proper protection, such as acid-resistant suits and neutralization potions, to safely face these challenges. Prolonged exposure to corrosive environments can cause significant damage.

- Elemental Cities:
	Cities within the elemental plane of Acid are constructed to withstand constant corrosion. They are made of acid-resistant materials and exist in stilts made of materials such as special stones or treated metals. Some cities may be built on floating platforms to avoid direct contact with the acidic ground, or made of solidified acid materials. The inhabitants of these cities are skilled in acid manipulation and employ advanced corrosion protection techniques.

- Elemental Landmarks:
	Scattered throughout the elemental plane of Acid, you can find unique and significant landmarks. This could include a large ancient acid crater, which has a mysterious energy and is considered sacred by acid elementalists. Another example could be an acid forest where corrosive trees and plants grow, and only those with proper protection can explore it. Each landmark has its own story and challenges associated with it.

- Elemental Landscapes:
	The distinct and fascinating landscapes present in the elemental plane of Acid are formed by the corrosive effects of the element in an eternal swamp. There are areas with rivers and lakes of acid, creating treacherous terrain where bridges and passages can be quickly corroded. Clearings in acid swamps with worn-down rocky formations are common, creating an impressive and hazardous backdrop. Corrosive swamps with toxic gases can also be found in this plane, presenting additional challenges to adventurers.
