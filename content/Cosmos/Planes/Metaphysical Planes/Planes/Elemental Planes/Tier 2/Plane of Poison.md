# Poison | An Endless Dark Plain Grassland Covered in Green And Purple Mist with Colossal Walls of Poison Gushing Upward in an Inverted Waterfall

- Elemental Theme:
	The primary elemental theme of this plane is Poison. It is a plane dedicated to the control of poisons and toxins with varying degrees and effects. The inhabitants of this plane possess abilities to create and manipulate poisons, causing lethal damage, curing poisonings, and controlling the bodies of those affected by poison.

- Plane Structure:
	The plane is an endless dark plain land covered in thick green and purple poisonous mists with colossal walls of poison gushing upwards in an inverted waterfall, the plane is divided into different regions or domains representing different types of poisons and toxins. There are areas with subtler and less lethal poisons, where the manipulation of toxins is refined and controlled, and regions with extremely deadly poisons, where death is imminent. These regions interact with each other through rivers and toxic currents, creating dangerous and treacherous landscapes.

- Elemental Inhabitants:
	The native inhabitants of this plane are Poison Elementalists, beings capable of creating and controlling poisons in various forms. There are also specific poison elemental creatures, such as Poison Elementals, formed from the very elemental essence of poison. Additionally, some creatures adapted to toxic environments, such as beings with immunity to poisons, venomous creatures and more potent variations of poisonous creatures from the [[material plane]], also call this plane home.

- Elemental Manifestations:
	Unique manifestations of poisonous forces occur throughout the plane. There can be dense toxic mists that cause different effects and weaken anything that comes into contact with them. Landscapes can be marked by lush poisonous plants and deadly flowers that exude lethal toxins. These manifestations affect the environment and its inhabitants, offering challenges and opportunities for those who explore the plane.

- Elemental Magic:
	The elemental energies of Poison influence magic in this plane. Spells related to poisons are more potent and effective here. Magic users can channel toxins and the deadly effects of poisons into their spells, causing additional damage and controlling the bodies and minds of those affected. Additionally, there are new spells and unique magical abilities involving poison manipulation.

- Plane Attributes:
	In this elemental plane of Poison, gravity functions similarly to the [[Material Plane]]. However, there is a constant presence of toxic mist in the air, requiring travelers to take additional precautions to avoid poisoning. Extreme temperature variations are common, with areas ranging from extremely toxic and hot to less toxic and cold. Time flows at a different pace compared to the [[Material Plane]], sometimes decelerating for those that become intoxicated with the poisons of the plane.

- Plane's Purpose:
	The purpose of this elemental plane of Poison is to be a source of lethal and controlling power. It also serves as a testing ground for the resilience and survival skills of adventurers. Additionally, this plane interacts with other planes, as toxins and poisons are elements that can cross dimensional barriers.

- Encounters in the Plane:
	Players may face challenges such as hostile factions of poison elementalists who protect their domain and view intruders as potential victims for their toxins. They can also encounter dangerous venomous creatures guarding valuable treasures related to rare poisons. Furthermore, there is the possibility of finding sources of knowledge about the creation of antidotes and healing potions in the plane.

- Plane Entry and Exit:
	There are access portals to the [[Material Plane]] that require specific rituals and the presence of specific poisons to activate them. These portals may be located in areas with concentrations of poisonous plants or venomous creatures. To close these portals, the associated poisons must be neutralized or removed.

- Plane Hazards:
	Environmental hazards in this plane include toxic mists that cause hallucinations and weaken, deadly poisonous plants, and creatures adapted to toxic environments. Players will need proper protection, such as gas masks and antidote potions, to safely face these challenges. Prolonged exposure to poisonous environments can cause significant damage.

- Elemental Cities:
	Cities within the elemental plane of Poison are built to withstand the effects of poisons. Cities might have houses with domes of glass surrounding them or have inhabitants that are imune to poison. Some cities may have gardens of poisonous plants and alchemical laboratories specialized in poisons and antidotes. The inhabitants of these cities are skilled in poison manipulation and use advanced protection techniques.

- Elemental Landmarks:
	Scattered throughout the elemental plane of Poison, you can find unique and significant landmarks. This could include a giant toxic forest, where poisonous trees reach extraordinary heights and venomous animals inhabit the area. Another example could be a cave deep into the roots of a huge tree, where toxic vapors fill the air and venomous creatures hide. Each landmark has its own story and challenges associated with it.

- Elemental Landscapes:
	The distinct and fascinating landscapes present in the elemental plane of Poison are formed by the effects of poisons and toxins with colossal walls surrounding a plain. There are areas with rivers of poison, creating treacherous terrain where bridges and passages can be quickly covered by poisonous condensation. Plains covered with poisonous plants exude lethal toxins, requiring adventurers to be cautious when traversing them. There are also caves with bright poisonous crystals and mountain peaks with poisonous mist.
