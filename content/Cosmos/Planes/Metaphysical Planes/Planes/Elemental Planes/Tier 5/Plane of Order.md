# Order | A Plane Maintaining Geometric Patterns with a Sky Resembling a Cube Fractal

- Elemental Theme:
	The primary elemental theme of the Order plane is Order itself. Order is associated with stability, predictability, and control of specific patterns, effects, and structures. In this plane, the harmony of predictable fractals and precise geometric patterns is a manifestation of the essence of Order.

- Plane Structure:
	The Order plane is organized into different domains or regions, each dedicated to a specific aspect of Order. These domains are like well-defined sectors of a vast interconnected fractal pattern, and each of them has its own characteristics and ordered laws governing it. Although they may appear independent, they harmoniously interact, forming a cohesive structure.

- Elemental Inhabitants:
	Elemental inhabitants of this plane are beings and creatures that personify Order. Genies of Order, beings made of pure ordered energy, are natives of this plane. Additionally, perfectly designed constructs and creatures made of geometric patterns can be found here. Magical beings associated with precision, logic, and balance may also call this plane home.

- Elemental Manifestations:
	Elemental manifestations in this plane are characterized by a mesmerizing display of fractals, geometric patterns, and ordered structures. There may be gardens where flowers bloom in perfect sequences and form living mandalas. Patterns of light and color move in harmony, creating a visually stunning dance. Complex and perfectly symmetrical architectural structures can be found everywhere.

- Elemental Magic:
	Magic in this plane is affected by Order's energies. Spells based on patterns, precision, and specific structures are more powerful and easier to perform. Users of magic in this plane can manipulate and rearrange magical patterns, stabilize reality, and even unravel illusions and chaos. Additionally, new spells can be discovered, allowing spellcasters to explore Order's magic in unique ways.

- Plane Attributes:
	In this elemental plane of Order, gravity functions predictably and stably, following specific laws. Time flows in an orderly and regular manner, allowing inhabitants to accurately predict the cycle of day and night. Temperature is controlled and balanced, providing a constant and comfortable climate throughout the plane. The landscape consists of geometric shapes and ordered structures, creating a visually impressive aesthetic.

- Plane's Purpose:
	The purpose of the elemental Order plane is to bring balance and stability to the multiverse. It is a realm where patterns are preserved, and predictability is valued. Order acts as a necessary counterpart to Chaos and other [[Elemental Planes|elemental planes]], providing a solid and structured foundation for existence.

- Encounters in the Plane:
	Players may face challenges such as Order guardians, powerful beings protecting the stability of the plane. Factions or cults seeking to impose excessive or oppressive order may also be encountered. Valuable treasures may be hidden in complex structures, and magical secrets may be revealed through puzzles and logical challenges.

- Plane Entry and Exit:
	Passages connecting the [[Material Plane]] to this elemental Order plane require precise rituals and knowledge of specific patterns. A portal can be activated by executing a complex sequence of gestures and movements in a specific pattern. Magical items or artifacts that attune users to the essence of Order can also be used to open these portals.

- Plane Hazards:
	Hazards in this elemental Order plane are related to excessive rigidity and lack of flexibility. Those who do not adapt or break the plane's precise rules may encounter resistance or harm. There is also the risk of being overwhelmed by the perfection and monotony of ordered structures.

- Elemental Cities:
	Cities within the elemental Order plane are impressive and highly symmetrical architectural constructions. They adapt perfectly to the ordered environment around them, with streets aligned at precise angles and buildings designed with geometric perfection. Daily life in these cities follows structured rituals and routines, creating a sense of stability and order.

- Elemental Landmarks:
	Landmarks in this elemental plane include natural features and constructions created by beings of Order. Examples may include a mountain that forms a perfect fractal when viewed from above, a labyrinth of translucent crystals that reflect light in magical patterns, or a colossal statue of a magical being associated with Order.

- Elemental Landscapes:
	Landscapes in the elemental Order plane are dominated by precise geometric shapes and intricate patterns. Vast plains feature perfectly level terrain with symmetrically aligned grasslands. Mountains rise in triangular and pyramidal forms, while rivers follow straight-line trajectories. The harmony and perfection of elemental patterns create a unique and fascinating atmosphere for adventurers to explore.
