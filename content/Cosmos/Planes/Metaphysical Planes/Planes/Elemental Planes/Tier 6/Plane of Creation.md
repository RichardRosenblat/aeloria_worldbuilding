	The Plane of Creation is composed of distinct regions dedicated to different aspects of creation. Each region is a unique domain where inhabitants explore and enhance their creative abilities. These domains are interconnected by magical pathways that traverse lush and vibrant landscapes.

- Elemental Inhabitants:
	The denizens of this plane are creatures and beings with a natural affinity for Creation. Magical artificers, reality sculptors, and celestial architects are just a few examples of the plane's inhabitants. Creative elementals, known as "Creators," are natives of the Plane of Creation. They are ethereal beings made of pure imagination and have the ability to shape the very fabric of reality.

- Elemental Manifestations:
	Elemental manifestations in the Plane of Creation are magnificent displays of art and ingenuity. Paintings come to life, sculptures transform into living beings, and buildings rise from nothingness. There are also areas where the landscape itself constantly changes as the imaginations of the inhabitants flow. The landscapes are filled with vibrant colors, fantastical shapes, and a sense of pulsating creative energy.

- Elemental Magic:
	The elemental energies of Creation amplify magic in this plane. Spellcasters have access to unique spells and magical abilities that allow them to create vivid illusions, materialize magical objects, and even breathe life into imaginary creatures. Summoning and transmutation magic is particularly potent in this plane, enabling practitioners to shape and transform reality with ease.

- Plane Attributes:
	The Plane of Creation has fluid gravity that can be shaped by the will of its inhabitants. Temperatures fluctuate according to the emotions and imagination of the people, ranging from cozy and warm to cool and refreshing. Time in this plane follows a creative flow, where events occur at different paces depending on the intensity of creation. The plane is constantly in motion and evolution, adapting to new ideas and visions of its inhabitants.

- Plane's Purpose:
	The purpose of the Plane of Creation is to serve as an infinite source of inspiration and creative expression in the multiverse. It is a realm of possibilities where imagination becomes reality. Additionally, the Plane of Creation plays a vital role in the balance of the multiverse, providing the necessary energy for the manifestation of other planes and dimensions.

Players may also face challenges that require specific creative skills to overcome.

	Landmarks in the Plane of Creation are physical manifestations of the imagination and creativity of its inhabitants. These unique landmarks can include floating towers made of dreams, gardens where plants are living sculptures, and ethereal art galleries that house magical masterpieces. Each landmark has its own story and mysteries to be discovered.
