# Description
In the vast and intricate tapestry of the Dungeons & Dragons multiverse, the Elemental Planes stand as realms of raw, primordial power, each representing a fundamental force that shapes the very fabric of existence. In the campaign, where the balance of existence and the interplay of opposing forces are paramount, delving into the Elemental Planes adds layers of mystique and complexity to your world.

The Elemental Planes are a set of parallel dimensions, each dedicated to a specific elemental essenceâ€”earth, air, fire, and water and more. Additionally, there some planes that bridge the gaps between these elements, forming subplanes like the plane of ice and the [[Plane of Fire]].
