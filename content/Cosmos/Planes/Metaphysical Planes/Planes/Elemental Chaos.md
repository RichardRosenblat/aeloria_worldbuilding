# Description
At the farthest extents of the [[Elemental Planes|Elemental Planes]], the pure elements dissolve and bleed together into an unending tumult of clashing energies and colliding substance inside an endless void called the Elemental Chaos. Elementals can be found here as well, but they usually don't stay long, preferring the comfort of their native planes. Reports indicate the existence of weird hybrid elementals native to the Elemental Chaos, but such creatures are seldom seen on other planes.

Each [[Elemental Planes|elemental plane]] exists in this space, even thought [[Elemental Planes|Elemental Planes]] are infinite, they are represented in the Elemental Chaos as bodies similar to planets, each with a different appearance, floating around the elemental chaos, with magical representations of connections between planes, for example [[the planes]] of water, earth, fire and air always have connections in between themselves, being shown as streaks of elemental energy connecting the [[Elemental Planes|Elemental Planes]]
