# Liminal Planes
The Liminal Planes also called Transition Planes are the [[Ethereal Plane|ethereal]] and enigmatic realms that act as bridges between various categories of planes, creating a web-like connection within the multiverse. These planes embody the [[Setting Info|Principles]] of continuity and change, as they enable the flow of energies and entities between other planes, allowing for the subtle transformations that shape existence.

The known Liminal Planes are the [[Astral Plane]] and the [[Ethereal Plane]]
