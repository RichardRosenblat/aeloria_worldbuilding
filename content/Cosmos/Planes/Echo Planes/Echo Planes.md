In the D&D campaign, the Echo Planes are enigmatic and parallel dimensions that exist alongside the [[material plane]], acting as both reflections and distortions of reality, reflecting landscapes among each other but never Individuals. These planes are deeply entwined with the [[Setting Info|Principles]] of continuity and change, where subtle transformations of existence give rise to distinct and mystical realms.

The Echo planes are the only planes that naturally touch the [[Ethereal Plane]] and the [[Astral Plane]] without the need of magic
