# The Metapsychic planes
The Metapsychic planes, often described as the "Realms of Thought and Soul," or “Outer Planes” are where the minds and souls of beings find their existence. These planes are deeply intertwined with consciousness and the essence of individuality, where thoughts and emotions are manifested as tangible landscapes and entities.

In the Metapsychic Realms, the universal connection, as well as the enduring and ever-changing nature of existence, come to life. Beings who venture into these realms may encounter sentient emotions, ancient memories, and the collective wisdom of all sentient life. These planes are a reflection of the interconnectedness of all minds and souls, providing a unique opportunity for adventurers to explore the depths of consciousness and gain insight into the nature of the soul.

Metapsychic planes are often divided in layers, and such layers may be divided in realms

Examples of Metapsychic planes are the [[Astral Sea]], Upper planes like [[Mount Celestia|Celestia]], [[Elysium]] and Lower planes like [[The nine hells]], [[the Abyss]] etc

## Traveling the Outer Planes
Traveling between the Outer Planes isn't dissimilar from reaching the Outer Planes in the first place. Characters traveling by means of the [astral projection](https://5e.tools/spells.html#astral%20projection_phb) spell can go from one plane into the [[Astral Plane]], and there search out a color pool leading to the desired destination. Characters can also use plane shift to reach a different plane more directly. Most often, though, characters use portals-either a portal that links the two planes directly or a portal leading to Sigil, City of Doors, which holds portals to all [[the planes]].

Two planar features connect multiple Outer Planes together: the River Styx and the Infinite Staircase. Other planar crossings might exist in your campaign, such as a World Tree whose roots touch the Lower Planes and whose branches reach to the Upper Planes, or it might be possible to walk from one plane to another in your cosmology.

### The River Styx

This river bubbles with grease, foul flotsam, and the putrid remains of battles along its banks. Any creature other than a fiend that tastes or touches the water is affected by a [feeblemind](https://5e.tools/spells.html#feeblemind_phb) spell. The DC of the Intelligence saving throw to resist the effect is 15.

The Styx churns through the top layers of [[Acheron]], [[the Nine Hells]], [[Gehenna]], [[Hades]], [[Carceri]],[[the Abyss]], and [[Pandemonium]]. Tributaries of the Styx snake onto lower layers of these planes. For example, a tendril of the Styx winds through every layer of [[the Nine Hells]], allowing passage from one layer of that plane to the next.

Sinister ferries float on the waters of the Styx, crewed by pilots skilled in negotiating the unpredictable currents and eddies of the river. For a price, these pilots are willing to carry passengers from plane to plane. Some of them are fiends, while others are the souls of dead creatures from the [[Material Plane]].

### The Infinite Staircase

The Infinite Staircase is an extra dimensional spiral staircase that connects [[the planes]]. An entrance to the Infinite Staircase usually appears as a nondescript door. Beyond the portal lies a small landing with an equally nondescript stairway leading up and down. The Infinite Staircase changes appearance as it climbs and descends, going from simple stairs of wood or stone to a chaotic jumble of stairs hanging in radiant space, where no two steps share the same gravitational orientation. It is said that one can find one's heart's desire on the Infinite Staircase through diligent searching of each landing.

Doors to the Infinite Staircase are often tucked away in dusty, half-forgotten places that no one frequents or pays any attention to. On any given plane, there can be multiple doors to the Infinite Staircase, though entrances aren't common knowledge and are occasionally guarded by devas, sphinxes, yugoloths, and other powerful monsters.
