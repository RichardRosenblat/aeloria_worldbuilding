# The Forbidden Lands of Yaalcahim
- **Plane Description**: A hidden plane, frozen in time until observed, with many layers. The first layer is a desolate land with scattered ruins. 
- **Gateway Access**: The gateway is hidden between mountains, teleporting through minds in the [[astral plane]] and mountains within the elemental [[plane of earth]]. Protected by powerful celestials, it connects to an enormous bridge leading to a temple.
- **Purpose**: The plane serves as a protection for the portal to [[Tharizdun, God of Madness - The Chained Oblivion (CE)|Tharizdun]]'s body demiplane, sealed by powerful constructs scattered across the Forbidden Lands.

## Plane Effect

- **Time Stasis**: The plane is frozen in time until observed, with creatures and objects suspended in motion. Time only flows when observed, creating a surreal and eerie atmosphere.
- **Corruption**: The plane is tainted by [[Tharizdun, God of Madness - The Chained Oblivion (CE)|Tharizdun]]'s hatred, causing madness and despair in those who linger too long. The longer one stays, the more they are affected by [[Tharizdun, God of Madness - The Chained Oblivion (CE)|the Chained Oblivion]]'s madness. At the end of a long rest, a visitor must make a DC 15, if failed, the creature gains one level of corruption. This corruption changes the creature's appearance and behavior, upon reaching six levels of corruption, the creature is transformed into a construct and permanently bound to the plane, gaining a new form and a new layer of the Forbidden Lands, but losing their free will. The only way to remove corruption is to leave the plane, divine intervention, or through casting *Greater Restoration* while within the temple.
