#  The Infinite Layers of the Abyss

The Abyss embodies all that is perverse, gruesome, and chaotic. Its virtually endless layers spiral downward into ever more appalling forms.

Each layer of the Abyss boasts its own horrific environment. Although no two layers are alike, they are all harsh and inhospitable. Each layer also reflects the entropic nature of the Abyss. In fact, much of what one sees or touches on the plane seems to be in a decaying, crumbling, or corroded state.

## Optional Rule: Abyssal Corruption

A non-evil visitor that finishes a long rest in the Abyss must make a DC 10 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, the creature becomes corrupted. Refer to the Abyssal Corruption table to determine the effects of this corruption. You can substitute different corruption effects of your own creation.

After finishing a long rest, a corrupted creature can make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a successful save, the corruption effect ends. A dispel evil and good spell or any magic that removes a curse also ends the effect.

If a corrupted creature doesn't leave the plane within `dice: 1d4+2` days, its alignment changes to chaotic evil. Casting the [dispel evil and good](https://5e.tools/spells.html#dispel%20evil%20and%20good_phb) spell on the creature restores its original alignment.

## Important Layers

The layers of the Abyss are defined by the demon lords who rule them, as the following examples illustrate. More information about the demon lords can be found in the Monster Manual.

### The Gaping Maw. 
Demogorgon's layer in the Abyss is a vast wilderness of savagery and madness known as the Gaping Maw, where even powerful demons go insane with fear. Reflecting Demogorgon's dual nature, the Gaping Maw consists of a massive primeval continent covered in dense jungle, surrounded by a seemingly endless expanse of ocean and brine flats. The Prince of Demons rules his layer from two serpentine towers, which emerge from a turbid sea. Each tower is topped with an enormous fanged skull. The spires constitute the fortress of Abysm, where few creatures can venture without descending into madness.

### [[Raven Queen, Goddess of Death, Crows and Winter - The Matron of Death (LN)|Thanatos]]. 
If Orcus had his way, all planes would resemble his dead realm of [[Raven Queen, Goddess of Death, Crows and Winter - The Matron of Death (LN)|Thanatos]], and all creatures would become undead under his control. Under its black sky, [[Raven Queen, Goddess of Death, Crows and Winter - The Matron of Death (LN)|Thanatos]] -named in mockery of the god of death of the same name, is a land of bleak mountains, barren moors, ruined cities, and forests of twisted black trees. Tombs, mausoleums, gravestones, and sarcophagi litter the landscape. Undead swarm across the plane, bursting from their tombs and graves to tear apart any creatures foolish enough to journey here. Orcus rules [[Raven Queen, Goddess of Death, Crows and Winter - The Matron of Death (LN)|Thanatos]] from a vast palace known as Everlost, crafted of obsidian and bone. Set within a howling wasteland called Oblivion's End, the palace is surrounded by tombs and burial sites dug into the sheer slopes of narrow valleys, creating a tiered necropolis.

### The Demonweb. 
[[Lolth, Goddess of Spiders and Lies - The Spider Queen (LE)|Lolth]]'s layer is an immense network of thick, magical webbing that forms passageways and cocoon-like chambers. Throughout the web, buildings, structures, ships, and other objects hang as if caught in a spider's snare. The nature of [[Lolth, Goddess of Spiders and Lies - The Spider Queen (LE)|Lolth]]'s web creates random portals throughout the plane, drawing such objects in from demiplanes and [[Material Plane]] worlds that figure into the schemes of [[Lolth, Goddess of Spiders and Lies - The Spider Queen (LE)|the Spider Queen]]. [[Lolth, Goddess of Spiders and Lies - The Spider Queen (LE)|Lolth]]'s servants also build dungeons amid the webbing, trapping and hunting [[Lolth, Goddess of Spiders and Lies - The Spider Queen (LE)|Lolth]]'s hated enemies within crisscrossing corridors of web-mortared stone.

Far beneath these dungeons lie the bottomless Demonweb Pits where [[Lolth, Goddess of Spiders and Lies - The Spider Queen (LE)|the Spider Queen]] dwells. There, [[Lolth, Goddess of Spiders and Lies - The Spider Queen (LE)|Lolth]] is surrounded by her handmaidens-yochlol demons created to serve her and which outrank mightier demons while in [[Lolth, Goddess of Spiders and Lies - The Spider Queen (LE)|the Spider Queen]]'s realm.

### The Endless Maze. 

Baphomet's layer of the Abyss is a never-ending dungeon, the center of which holds the Horned King's enormous ziggurat palace. A confusing jumble of crooked hallways and myriad chambers, the palace is surrounded by a mile-wide moat concealing a maddening series of submerged stairs and tunnels leading deeper into the fortress.

### The Triple Realm. 

The Dark Prince Graz'zt rules over the realm of Azzagrat, which encompasses three layers of the Abyss. His seat of power is the fantastic Argent Palace in the city of Zelatar, whose bustling markets and pleasure palaces draw visitors from across the multiverse in search of obscure magical lore and perverse delights. By Graz'zt's command, the demons of Azzagrat present a veneer of civility and courtly comity. However, the so-called Triple Realm holds as much danger as any other part of the Abyss, and planar visitors can vanish without a trace in its maze like cities and in forests whose trees have serpents for branches.

### Death Dells. 

Yeenoghu rules a layer of ravines known as Death Dells. Here, creatures must hunt to survive. Even the plants, which must bathe their roots in blood, snare the unwary. Yeenoghu's servants, helping to sate their master's hunger as he prowls his kingdom seeking prey, capture creatures from the [[Material Plane]] for release in the Gnoll Lord's realm.

### Dragonrend Realm

This layer is the home of [[Tiamat, Goddess of wealth, greed, and vengeance - The Scaled Tyrant (CE)|Tiamat, the Queen of Dragons]]. The layer is divided into five regions, each corresponding to one of the five chromatic dragon types. The regions are separated by vast expanses of inhospitable terrain, and each is ruled by a powerful dragon lord who serves [[Tiamat, Goddess of wealth, greed, and vengeance - The Scaled Tyrant (CE)|Tiamat]]. The regions are as follows:

**1. Mirefang Marshes (Black Dragon Territory):**
   - **Characteristics:** This region is dominated by fetid swamps and murky waters. Thick mist blankets the air, and the ground is saturated with acidic pools that sizzle and bubble. Twisted trees with gnarled roots rise from the muck, casting eerie shadows. The atmosphere is oppressive, filled with the constant hum of insects and the occasional hiss of acidic steam vents. The sky is often obscured by dense, low-hanging clouds, perpetually darkening the landscape.

**2. Electric Wastes (Blue Dragon Territory):**
   - **Characteristics:** Endless stretches of desert dunes dominate this area, where fierce sandstorms rage across the landscape, crackling with electrical energy. Jagged rock formations jut from the sands, occasionally struck by lightning. Blue-tinted lightning arcs through the storm clouds that gather above, illuminating the harsh terrain with flashes of brilliance. The air crackles with ozone, and the ground trembles with the occasional discharge of static electricity.

**3. Verdant Horror (Green Dragon Territory):**
   - **Characteristics:** A dense, ancient forest blankets this region, where towering trees form a lush canopy that filters sunlight into dappled patterns on the forest floor. Thick undergrowth and vines intertwine, creating a maze-like network that obscures the path ahead. The air is heavy with the scent of damp earth and the sweet aroma of exotic flowers. Poisonous plants and fungi thrive here, their vibrant colors belying their deadly nature. Shadows dance among the trees, hinting at unseen predators stalking their prey.

**4. Infernal Peaks (Red Dragon Territory):**
   - **Characteristics:** This part of the layer is dominated by towering volcanoes that belch rivers of molten lava into the surrounding landscape. The sky is often darkened by billowing ash clouds, lit from within by the pulsing glow of magma flows. The air is thick with the acrid scent of sulfur and the heat is oppressive, making the ground shimmer with heatwaves. Cracked, obsidian-like rock formations jut from the scorched earth, casting ominous silhouettes against the fiery glow of the volcanoes.

**5. Glacial Fringes (White Dragon Territory):**
   - **Characteristics:** A vast, icy wasteland stretches across this region, where towering glaciers gleam like crystalline spires under the pale light of a perpetually cold sun. Endless snowfields and frost-covered plains extend to the horizon, broken only by jagged ice formations and frozen lakes that reflect the stark beauty of the surroundings. Bone-chilling winds howl across the landscape, carrying icy shards that bite into exposed skin. The air is so cold that each breath freezes in a misty cloud, and the silence is absolute, broken only by the occasional crack of shifting ice.
  
At the center of the layer lies Draconspire, a colossal castle where [[Tiamat, Goddess of wealth, greed, and vengeance - The Scaled Tyrant (CE)|Tiamat]] can rule over her domain and hoard her treasures from [[The Nine Hells#Avernus|Avernus]].

**Center: Draconspire**
   - **Characteristics:** Rising from the heart of Dragonrend Realm is Draconspire, a colossal castle crafted from obsidian-black stone. Five towering spires, each representing a dragon type, pierce the sky like jagged teeth. The castle's walls are adorned with intricate carvings depicting scenes of draconic conquest and hoarded treasures beyond imagination. Inside lies a labyrinth of chambers filled with endless riches—piles of gold, gem-encrusted artifacts, and ancient tomes of forbidden knowledge. The castle itself pulses with a dark, formidable energy, a testament to [[Tiamat, Goddess of wealth, greed, and vengeance - The Scaled Tyrant (CE)|Tiamat]]'s power and greed. At the heart of Draconspire is the Dragon's Throne, a massive obsidian seat adorned with the skulls of fallen foes and the bones of ancient dragons. Laying above the throne is the Crown of [[Tiamat, Goddess of wealth, greed, and vengeance - The Scaled Tyrant (CE)|Tiamat]], a five-headed circlet that channels the Queen of Dragons' power and binds her to her domain. Inbetween the five towers, there is a massive portal that leads to the [[The Nine Hells#Avernus|The Nine Hells]].


### Badlands of the One-Eyed King

[[Gruumsh, God of Destruction - The Ruiner (CE)|Gruumsh]] commands this layer, it reflects the relentless chaos and unending conflict that embodies the domains of the one-eyed god of war and destruction. It is a place where battles rage eternally, and the very landscape is shaped by the brutality of ceaseless warfare.

**Overview:**
The Badlands of the One-Eyed King, the infernal domain of [[Gruumsh, God of Destruction - The Ruiner (CE)|Gruumsh]], are a perpetual battlefield where war is both the beginning and the end. This layer of the Abyss is a sprawling, desolate expanse where the ground is a mixture of cracked, scorched earth and thick, congealed blood. The air is filled with the scent of iron and decay, and the sky is an scorching expanse with thorning clouds that crackle with lightning.

**The Fields of Carnage:**
The landscape is littered with the remnants of countless battles. Rivers of blood flow endlessly, their crimson waters thick and sluggish, winding through the battlefield like veins. Sharp weapons of every kind are strewn about, some half-buried in the ground, others lying next to the bodies of the fallen. The dead are in various stages of decay, their faces twisted in eternal agony.

**Weapons and Terrain:**
Weapons are omnipresent, from rusted swords and broken spears to shattered shields and splintered axes. They jut out from the ground at odd angles, creating a perilous terrain where each step could lead to a fatal wound. The very earth seems to hunger for blood, as pools of crimson ooze up from the ground, eager to swallow the living and the dead alike.

**The Citadel of Blades:**
At the heart of the Badlands of the One-Eyed King stands the Citadel of Blades, a massive, asymmetrical fortress constructed entirely from intertwined weapons. Swords, axes, spears, and shields are fused together to form walls, towers, and battlements. The citadel is a chaotic and jagged structure, reflecting the brutal and unrelenting nature of [[Gruumsh, God of Destruction - The Ruiner (CE)|Gruumsh]] himself.

**The Citadel's Interior:**
Inside the Citadel of Blades, the corridors are narrow and winding, the walls lined with razor-sharp weapons. The throne room, where [[Gruumsh, God of Destruction - The Ruiner (CE)|Gruumsh]] resides, is a grand hall filled with the trophies of his victories—skulls, banners, and the shattered remnants of powerful foes. The throne itself is a grotesque masterpiece, a twisted amalgamation of the finest weapons, with a seat made of the bones of legendary warriors.

**[[Gruumsh, God of Destruction - The Ruiner (CE)|Gruumsh]]’s Presence:**
[[Gruumsh, God of Destruction - The Ruiner (CE)|Gruumsh]], the one-eyed god of war and destruction, is ever-present in this layer. His bloodshot eye watches over the battlefield, filled with a relentless hunger for war and chaos. His booming voice can be heard across the wasteland, inciting the souls trapped there to fight endlessly, ensuring that the carnage never ceases.

**Denizens:**
The Badlands of the One-Eyed King are inhabited by the spirits of fallen warriors, demons of war, and savage orcs, all eternally bound to [[Gruumsh, God of Destruction - The Ruiner (CE)|Gruumsh]]’s service. They are locked in an endless cycle of battle, driven by an insatiable thirst for blood and glory. These denizens find no rest or respite, for to die in the Badlands of the One-Eyed King is to rise again and continue the slaughter.

### Krelshi-Tranor: The Seed of Evil

Beyond the infinite layers, in a paradoxical state, lies the final layer, the source of all others: Krelshi-Tranor. This primeval layer, created by the [[true gods]], came into existence when they hurled the crystallized divine power of [[Tharizdun, God of Entropy and Madness - The Chained Oblivion (CE)|Tharizdun]] into the [[astral plane]]. Corrupted by the influence of the [[The Far Realm|Far Realms]], [[Tharizdun, God of Entropy and Madness - The Chained Oblivion (CE)|Tharizdun]]'s power began to create the Abyss as it sank into the [[astral plane]]. The infinite layers of the Abyss emerged from the madness and chaos that had infiltrated [[Tharizdun, God of Entropy and Madness - The Chained Oblivion (CE)|Tharizdun]]'s essence.

Krelshi-Tranor is a realm of grotesque, contorted meat, twisted in horrifying ways. Eyes, hands, wings, mouths and tentacles sprout from the flesh, writhing and screaming in agony before spitting out profanity and blasphemy as they are absorbed back into the mass. Rivers of blood, pus, and ichor course through the layer, beneath a dark ochre sky with yellow and green clouds that baptizes the ground below with acidic rain. Scattered across the sky are numerous floating one-way portals to the deepest layers of the Abyss.

The horrid flesh of Krelshi-Tranor is in constant motion, screaming and shifting to form new shapes and abominations. Occasionally, pieces of this flesh break off, becoming demons and other monstrosities. Every two hours, massive earthquakes shake the layer, causing the meat to contort and shift, redirecting rivers of blood and pus. Giant tentacles rise from the ground, and gaping maws open into vast cave systems. When the tremors cease, a new layer of the Abyss is born, rendering Krelshi-Tranor unrecognizable from its previous state.

Legends tell of immense dark creatures dwelling within the flesh, surviving as parasites in the maddening chaos of Krelshi-Tranor. These beings, among the most powerful in the Abyss, carve tunnels and lairs through the meat and blood, held together by their creator's sheer hatred and power.

In the deepest reaches of Krelshi-Tranor, beyond thousands of kilometers of flesh and blood, lies a giant, multicolored crystal. This crystal, sharing the name of the layer, continually generates new flesh in chaotic patterns, ensuring the perpetual growth and transformation of the realm. Only gods have reached this crystal, but myths speak of powerful artifacts created from its fragments, said to possess immense and catastrophic power. Such artifacts are believed to be capable of creating portals to the Krelishi-Tranor, allowing mortals to traverse the Abyss and reach the crystal.

Orbiting this layer there are two demiplanes, the plane where the body of [[Tharizdun, God of Entropy and Madness - The Chained Oblivion (CE)|Tharizdun]] was sealed and the plane where its mind was imprisoned. These demiplanes are inaccesible to anyone but the gods, the only way to reach them is by finding the only two portals that connect to them, one in the body's prison and one in the mind's prison. The portal to the body's prison is hidden within The [[Yawnohim|Forbidden Lands of Yawnohim]], being only accessible after multiple trials and tribulations, specially to find the gate to [[Yawnohim]] which is hidden in the deepest part of the [[astral plane]] and the [[Plane of Earth|earth plane]] while being protected by extremely powerful creatures. The portal to the mind's prison is hidden surrounded by an ellipsoidal shell made of porous black stone known as [[The Cyst]], this shell is changes location constantly. The only way to find the portal is by using a special key that is hidden in a lost location in the multiverse, it is said that the key is a specific grain of sand in a desert.

The body's prison is a empty expanse, with a dark floor made of an unknown material and a void sky, with dangling chains and hooks. At the center of the plane there is the body of a humanoid, covered in metal and chains, secured in place by hooks that seal the body in place. From the body, a red energy flows upwards and pulsates, this energy causes madness to anyone within the plane.

The mind's prison is an enormous temple, with a dark floor of stone and pillars made of red stone that reach for the infinity above, adorned with a dark sky and a red sun always stuck in an eclipse. Walls made of stone bricks limit the horizon, having no floor past them, only an endless void. Across the walls, many frescoes depict horrors and madness, with humanoids without faces in various states of agony and despair. The temple is filled with the whispers of [[Tharizdun, God of Entropy and Madness - The Chained Oblivion (CE)|the chained god]] and at the center there are three enormous wooden statues, one of [[Aena, goddess of kindness, creation and order - The Architect (LG)|Aena]] in the left, one of [[Kryela, goddess of malice, destruction and chaos - The Undoing (CE)|Kryela]] in the right, and one of [[Tharizdun, God of Entropy and Madness - The Chained Oblivion (CE)|Tharizdun]] in the center. In front of these statues there is a bag made of skin, tied above the ground by chains that extend to endless sky above and to the walls of the temple. The bag emits a heartbeat and whispers the secrets of the [[Tharizdun, God of Entropy and Madness - The Chained Oblivion (CE)|god of madness]], it has a lattice of magical energy that prevents [[Tharizdun, God of Entropy and Madness - The Chained Oblivion (CE)|Tharizdun]] from escaping or focusing in any way.
