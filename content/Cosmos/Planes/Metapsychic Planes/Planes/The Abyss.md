#  The Infinite Layers of the Abyss

The Abyss embodies all that is perverse, gruesome, and chaotic. Its virtually endless layers spiral downward into ever more appalling forms.

Each layer of the Abyss boasts its own horrific environment. Although no two layers are alike, they are all harsh and inhospitable. Each layer also reflects the entropic nature of the Abyss. In fact, much of what one sees or touches on the plane seems to be in a decaying, crumbling, or corroded state.

## Optional Rule: Abyssal Corruption

A non-evil visitor that finishes a long rest in the Abyss must make a DC 10 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, the creature becomes corrupted. Refer to the Abyssal Corruption table to determine the effects of this corruption. You can substitute different corruption effects of your own creation.

After finishing a long rest, a corrupted creature can make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a successful save, the corruption effect ends. A dispel evil and good spell or any magic that removes a curse also ends the effect.

If a corrupted creature doesn't leave the plane within `dice: 1d4+2` days, its alignment changes to chaotic evil. Casting the [dispel evil and good](https://5e.tools/spells.html#dispel%20evil%20and%20good_phb) spell on the creature restores its original alignment.

## Important Layers

The layers of the Abyss are defined by the demon lords who rule them, as the following examples illustrate. More information about the demon lords can be found in the Monster Manual.

### The Gaping Maw. 
Demogorgon's layer in the Abyss is a vast wilderness of savagery and madness known as the Gaping Maw, where even powerful demons go insane with fear. Reflecting Demogorgon's dual nature, the Gaping Maw consists of a massive primeval continent covered in dense jungle, surrounded by a seemingly endless expanse of ocean and brine flats. The Prince of Demons rules his layer from two serpentine towers, which emerge from a turbid sea. Each tower is topped with an enormous fanged skull. The spires constitute the fortress of Abysm, where few creatures can venture without descending into madness.

### [[Raven Queen, Goddess of Death, Crows and Winter - The Matron of Death (LN)|Thanatos]]. 
If Orcus had his way, all planes would resemble his dead realm of [[Raven Queen, Goddess of Death, Crows and Winter - The Matron of Death (LN)|Thanatos]], and all creatures would become undead under his control. Under its black sky, [[Raven Queen, Goddess of Death, Crows and Winter - The Matron of Death (LN)|Thanatos]] -named in mockery of the god of death of the same name, is a land of bleak mountains, barren moors, ruined cities, and forests of twisted black trees. Tombs, mausoleums, gravestones, and sarcophagi litter the landscape. Undead swarm across the plane, bursting from their tombs and graves to tear apart any creatures foolish enough to journey here. Orcus rules [[Raven Queen, Goddess of Death, Crows and Winter - The Matron of Death (LN)|Thanatos]] from a vast palace known as Everlost, crafted of obsidian and bone. Set within a howling wasteland called Oblivion's End, the palace is surrounded by tombs and burial sites dug into the sheer slopes of narrow valleys, creating a tiered necropolis.

### The Demonweb. 
[[Lolth, Goddess of Spiders and Lies - The Spider Queen (LE)|Lolth]]'s layer is an immense network of thick, magical webbing that forms passageways and cocoon-like chambers. Throughout the web, buildings, structures, ships, and other objects hang as if caught in a spider's snare. The nature of [[Lolth, Goddess of Spiders and Lies - The Spider Queen (LE)|Lolth]]'s web creates random portals throughout the plane, drawing such objects in from demiplanes and [[Material Plane]] worlds that figure into the schemes of [[Lolth, Goddess of Spiders and Lies - The Spider Queen (LE)|the Spider Queen]]. [[Lolth, Goddess of Spiders and Lies - The Spider Queen (LE)|Lolth]]'s servants also build dungeons amid the webbing, trapping and hunting [[Lolth, Goddess of Spiders and Lies - The Spider Queen (LE)|Lolth]]'s hated enemies within crisscrossing corridors of web-mortared stone.

Far beneath these dungeons lie the bottomless Demonweb Pits where [[Lolth, Goddess of Spiders and Lies - The Spider Queen (LE)|the Spider Queen]] dwells. There, [[Lolth, Goddess of Spiders and Lies - The Spider Queen (LE)|Lolth]] is surrounded by her handmaidens-yochlol demons created to serve her and which outrank mightier demons while in [[Lolth, Goddess of Spiders and Lies - The Spider Queen (LE)|the Spider Queen]]'s realm.

### The Endless Maze. 

Baphomet's layer of the Abyss is a never-ending dungeon, the center of which holds the Horned King's enormous ziggurat palace. A confusing jumble of crooked hallways and myriad chambers, the palace is surrounded by a mile-wide moat concealing a maddening series of submerged stairs and tunnels leading deeper into the fortress.

### The Triple Realm. 

The Dark Prince Graz'zt rules over the realm of Azzagrat, which encompasses three layers of the Abyss. His seat of power is the fantastic Argent Palace in the city of Zelatar, whose bustling markets and pleasure palaces draw visitors from across the multiverse in search of obscure magical lore and perverse delights. By Graz'zt's command, the demons of Azzagrat present a veneer of civility and courtly comity. However, the so-called Triple Realm holds as much danger as any other part of the Abyss, and planar visitors can vanish without a trace in its maze like cities and in forests whose trees have serpents for branches.

### Death Dells. 

Yeenoghu rules a layer of ravines known as Death Dells. Here, creatures must hunt to survive. Even the plants, which must bathe their roots in blood, snare the unwary. Yeenoghu's servants, helping to sate their master's hunger as he prowls his kingdom seeking prey, capture creatures from the [[Material Plane]] for release in the Gnoll Lord's realm.

### The Endless Pools

- pools with 3 realms one on top of another
- [https://backrooms.fandom.com/wiki/Level_37](https://backrooms.fandom.com/wiki/Level_37)
    - Level 1 with blue sky, [[Solis|sun]], clear water and bright tiles, algae and small fish
    - Level 2 with eternal sunset, darker rooms, angler algae and fish that eat dead skin and greener water and diving suits
    - Level 3 → Pitch black walkways in the deep void, walkways made of rusty metal and are slippery, they hand in chains with big statues with blinking eyes in the depts and anglers lights spread around being lost in the abyss, currents come pushing adventurers ever so slightly into the depths, minefields and monsters

### Krelshi-Tranor

Beyond the infinite layers, in a paradoxical state, lies the final layer, the source of all others: Krelshi-Tranor. This primeval layer, created by the [[true gods]], came into existence when they hurled the crystallized divine power of [[Tharizdun, God of Entropy and Madness - The Chained Oblivion (CE)|Tharizdun]] into the [[astral plane]]. Corrupted by the influence of the [[The Far Realm|Far Realms]], [[Tharizdun, God of Entropy and Madness - The Chained Oblivion (CE)|Tharizdun]]'s power began to create the Abyss as it sank into the [[astral plane]]. The infinite layers of the Abyss emerged from the madness and chaos that had infiltrated [[Tharizdun, God of Entropy and Madness - The Chained Oblivion (CE)|Tharizdun]]'s essence.

Krelshi-Tranor is a realm of grotesque, contorted meat, twisted in horrifying ways. Eyes, hands, wings, mouths and tentacles sprout from the flesh, writhing and screaming in agony before spitting out profanity and blasphemy as they are absorbed back into the mass. Rivers of blood, pus, and ichor course through the layer, beneath a dark ochre sky with yellow and green clouds that baptizes the ground below with acidic rain. Scattered across the sky are numerous floating one-way portals to the deepest layers of the Abyss.

The horrid flesh of Krelshi-Tranor is in constant motion, screaming and shifting to form new shapes and abominations. Occasionally, pieces of this flesh break off, becoming demons and other monstrosities. Every two hours, massive earthquakes shake the layer, causing the meat to contort and shift, redirecting rivers of blood and pus. Giant tentacles rise from the ground, and gaping maws open into vast cave systems. When the tremors cease, a new layer of the Abyss is born, rendering Krelshi-Tranor unrecognizable from its previous state.

Legends tell of immense dark creatures dwelling within the flesh, surviving as parasites in the maddening chaos of Krelshi-Tranor. These beings, among the most powerful in the Abyss, carve tunnels and lairs through the meat and blood, held together by their creator's sheer hatred and power.

In the deepest reaches of Krelshi-Tranor, beyond thousands of kilometers of flesh and blood, lies a giant, multicolored crystal. This crystal, sharing the name of the layer, continually generates new flesh in chaotic patterns, ensuring the perpetual growth and transformation of the realm. Only gods have reached this crystal, but myths speak of powerful artifacts created from its fragments, said to possess immense and catastrophic power.

Orbiting this layer there are two demiplanes, the plane where the body of [[Tharizdun, God of Entropy and Madness - The Chained Oblivion (CE)|Tharizdun]] was sealed and the plane where its mind was imprisoned. These demiplanes are inaccesible to anyone but the gods, the only way to reach them is by finding the only two portals that connect to them, one in the body's prison and one in the mind's prison. The portal to the body's prison is hidden within The [[Yawnohim|Forbidden Lands of Yawnohim]], being only accessible after multiple trials and tribulations, specially to find the gate to [[Yawnohim]] which is hidden in the deepest part of the [[astral plane]] and the [[Plane of Earth|earth plane]] while being protected by extremely powerful creatures. The portal to the mind's prison is hidden surrounded by an ellipsoidal shell made of porous black stone known as [[The Cyst]], this shell is changes location constantly. The only way to find the portal is by using a special key that is hidden in a lost location in the multiverse, it is said that the key is a specific grain of sand in a desert.

The body's prison is a empty expanse, with a dark floor made of an unknown material and a void sky, with dangling chains and hooks. At the center of the plane there is the body of a humanoid, covered in metal and chains, secured in place by hooks that seal the body in place. From the body, a red energy flows upwards and pulsates, this energy causes madness to anyone within the plane.

The mind's prison is an enormous temple, with a dark floor of stone and pillars made of red stone that reach for the infinity above, adorned with a dark sky and a red sun always stuck in an eclipse. Walls made of stone bricks limit the horizon, having no floor past them, only an endless void. Across the walls, many frescoes depict horrors and madness, with humanoids without faces in various states of agony and despair. The temple is filled with the whispers of [[Tharizdun, God of Entropy and Madness - The Chained Oblivion (CE)|the chained god]] and at the center there are three enormous wooden statues, one of [[Aena, goddess of kindness, creation and order - The Architect (LG)|Aena]] in the left, one of [[Kryela, goddess of malice, destruction and chaos - The Undoing (CE)|Kryela]] in the right, and one of [[Tharizdun, God of Entropy and Madness - The Chained Oblivion (CE)|Tharizdun]] in the center. In front of these statues there is a bag made of skin, tied above the ground by chains that extend to endless sky above and to the walls of the temple. The bag emits a heartbeat and whispers the secrets of the [[Tharizdun, God of Entropy and Madness - The Chained Oblivion (CE)|god of madness]], it has a lattice of magical energy that prevents [[Tharizdun, God of Entropy and Madness - The Chained Oblivion (CE)|Tharizdun]] from escaping or focusing in any way.
