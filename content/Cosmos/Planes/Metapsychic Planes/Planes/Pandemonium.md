#  Windswept Depths of Pandemonium

Pandemonium is a plane of madness, a great mass of rock riddled with tunnels carved by howling winds. It is cold, noisy, and dark, with no natural light. Wind quickly extinguishes nonmagical open flames such as torches and campfires. It also makes conversation possible only by yelling, and even then only to a maximum distance of 10 feet. Creatures have disadvantage on any ability check that relies on hearing. Most of the plane's inhabitants are creatures that were banished to the plane with no hope of escape, and many of them have been driven mad by the incessant winds or forced to take shelter in places where the winds die down until they sound like distant cries of torment.

## Optional Rule: Mad Winds

A visitor must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw after each hour spent among the howling winds. On a failed save, the creature gains one level of [exhaustion](https://5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#exhaustion_phb). A creature that reaches six levels of [exhaustion](https://5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#exhaustion_phb) while on this plane doesn't die. Instead, the creature gains a random form of indefinite madness. Finishing a long rest doesn't reduce a creature's [exhaustion](https://5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#exhaustion_phb) level unless the creature can somehow escape the maddening winds.
