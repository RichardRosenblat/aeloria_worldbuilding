In the mystical realms beyond [[The Greater Limit]], where the fabric of reality unravels, lies a cosmic tapestry woven with threads of inconceivable wonders and abominable horrors â€“ the Non-realities. These elusive planes, concealed from mortal comprehension, exist as ethereal domains beyond the boundaries of conventional understanding. Within this uncharted expanse, adventurers may encounter the [[The Eternal Workshop|Phlogiston]] Currents of [[the Eternal Workshop]], where multiple realities converge amidst an eternal sea of otherworldly [[The Eternal Workshop|Phlogiston]]. Further still, looming on the fringes of sanity, lie the Maddening Domains of [[The Far Realm]], a realm of uncontrolled reality and the nightmarish abode of elder evils that defy the very essence of mortal cognition. To traverse [[The Greater Limit]] is to step into the meta-logical unknown, where the delicate balance of existence teeters on the precipice, and the courageous few who dare venture forth must navigate the tumultuous currents of these Non-realities, where the boundaries between reality and madness blur into an enigmatic dance.
