# The Phlogiston

In the vast and mysterious expanse beyond "[[The Greater Limit]]," lies a celestial tapestry known as The Eternal Workshop, often referred to simply as "The Phlogiston." This cosmic ocean of sublime chaos serves as a gateway to unimaginable cosmic journeys, where Crystal Spheres float like brilliant gems amidst iridescent colors, swirling [[Astronomical objects|nebulae]], and radiant mists.

## A Cosmic Ocean of Sublime Chaos

The Eternal Workshop is an endless, ever-shifting sea of iridescent colors, swirling [[Astronomical objects|nebulae]], and radiant mists. This cosmic ocean defies the laws of nature, an expanse where the very fabric of reality is in a constant state of flux. It is a place where the cosmos itself becomes liquid, and the mind must bend to accept the wonders and terrors that await.

## The [[The Far Realm|Far Realms]]' Influence

The Eternal Workshop is not an isolated realm but rather a buffer between realities and the infinite madness of the [[The Far Realm|Far Realms]], which loom as an omnipresent and ominous presence on the fringes of this celestial sea. The [[The Far Realm|Far Realms]] slowly cast their chaotic influence upon the Phlogiston of the Eternal Workshop, giving it an eerie and unstable quality. As a result, traversing this space is not for the faint of heart, with areas where the influence of the [[The Far Realm|Far Realms]] are stronger in the Phlogiston.

## Navigating the Cosmic Currents

Ships, equipped with arcane technology and guarded knowledge, venture into The Eternal Workshop with the intent of exploring new horizons. These intrepid vessels rely on advanced navigation, mystical charts, and calculations to find safe paths amidst the chaos. Crew members must be skilled at reading the ever-changing signs in the stars, identifying routes that allow passage from one Crystal Sphere to another.

## The Fractured Nature of the Eternal Workshop

The Eternal Workshop is not a uniform expanse; it is fractured and fragmented, with shifting boundaries and pockets of relative stability and chaos. These pockets become the lifelines for travelers, offering safe havens and brief respite from the [[The Far Realm|Far Realms]]' madness. It is within these pockets that diverse cosmic lifeforms dwell and extraordinary phenomena occur.

## A Realm of Cosmic Secrets

The Eternal Workshop holds countless cosmic secrets, forgotten realms, and realms yet to be discovered. It teems with celestial beings, each a guardian or explorer in their own right. The pursuit of these secrets, the trade of ancient knowledge, and the quest to harness the power of the Eternal Workshop are all part of the grand narrative that unfolds within this cosmic sea.

## The Nexus of Existence

The Eternal Workshop, with its paradoxical blend of harmony and chaos, serves as the nexus that keeps the Balance of Existence in check. It stands as a testament to the enduring, ever-changing nature of the cosmos, where the love for exploration and discovery knows no bounds.

## The Divine Forge of [[Aena, goddess of kindness, creation and order - The Architect (LG)|Aena]] and [[Kryela, goddess of malice, destruction and chaos - The Undoing (CE)|Kryela]]

Amidst the swirling currents and iridescent hues of the Phlogiston, whispers of divine origin permeate the cosmic tapestry. Legends spun through the eons speak of the Eternal Workshop, a plane forged by the [[Over-Deities]] [[Aena, goddess of kindness, creation and order - The Architect (LG)|Aena]] and [[Kryela, goddess of malice, destruction and chaos - The Undoing (CE)|Kryela]] as their celestial atelier, where the raw materials of reality are shaped and molded. In this mystical workshop, the [[Over-Deities]] intricately weave the threads of existence, balancing opposing forces with divine finesse. It is said that the very essence of creation flows from their divine hands, casting ripples across the vast expanse of the Eternal Workshop. This sacred origin lends an divine layer to the cosmic sea, where the interplay of elements mirrors the delicate dance of the [[Over-Deities]] at the heart of the Eternal Workshop. Travelers who dare to delve into the depths of the Phlogiston may find echoes of this divine craftsmanship, a testament to the divine touch that permeates the realms they explore.

## Dark Regions

Certain areas within the Phlogiston are shrouded in ominous shadows known as Dark Regions. These expansive clouds of pure horror pose a perilous challenge to adventurers, requiring caution and strategic navigation to traverse safely through their obscured depths.

## The Fluid Dynamics of Phlogiston

The Phlogiston, far from a homogeneous expanse, reveals a dynamic fluidity that shapes the cosmic sea. Its density varies across different realms, creating river-like flows that weave through the iridescent tapestry. These currents, at times, connect celestial objects such as the crystal spheres, establishing a celestial network within the fluid fabric of the Phlogiston. Some ships harness these flows, increasing their speeds by strategically navigating the currents, and some ships even utilize sails to amplify their contact area with the flowing essence, achieving extraordinary velocities across the vast distances of the Eternal Workshop.

Crystal spheres, floating freely in this sea, occasionally shift positions relative to one another. Despite these movements, the unchanging nature of the flow enables navigators to traverse the cosmic rivers and maintain their celestial course. Some currents flow bidirectionally, offering flexible routes, while others impose a unidirectional force, necessitating alternate paths for return journeys.

The Phlogiston itself, an semi-transparent, brilliant, and multicolored fluid half liquid and half gaseous, defies elemental classification. It cannot exist within crystal spheres and dissipates swiftly if brought inside. However, as ships sail through the Phlogiston, the fluid permeates any unprotected air envelopes. Remarkably, attempts to replicate this enigmatic substance prove futile, and its inherent flammability demands vigilance. The slightest spark or flame, magical or mundane, triggers explosive reactions, engulfing ships and their surroundings. As a precaution, travelers extinguish all flames before venturing beyond their crystal spheres, relying on magical or flameless illumination to navigate the enclosed spaces of their vessels.

The obscuring nature of the Phlogiston acts as an impenetrable barrier, blocking access to other planes. Even powerful magical constructs like Mordenkainen's magnificent mansion or extradimensional spaces created by items like portable holes remain inaccessible within the flowing currents of the cosmic sea. Only through potent magic, such as a limited wish spell, can one breach these barriers and access the uncharted realms beyond the Phlogiston's veil.
