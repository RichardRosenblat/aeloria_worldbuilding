# The Plane of Madness

In the vast expanse of the multiverse, where the threads of reality fray and sanity unravels, lies the dreaded Far Realm. This plane of madness, situated far beyond the reaches of the standard cosmology, is a nightmarish realm feared for its ability to twist the minds of those unfortunate enough to venture into its otherworldly depths. It is from the Far Realm that aberrations, grotesque and otherworldly creatures, emerge to haunt the nightmares of the living.

## Layers of Insanity

The Far Realm comprises an unfathomable number of layers, each as thin as an inch or as thick as a mile, separated by a mere ten feet. Transparent and morphic, these layers exist in a perpetual state of flux, ever-evaporating, dividing, spawning, and breathing. Alien entities drift through them, shaping the very fabric of reality in their wake. Glimpses through the layers reveal a disorienting panorama, each layer appearing increasingly blurred, like a surreal storm drifting across a cosmic canvas.

## Multidimensional Landscapes

Landmarks and entities in the Far Realm defy conventional understanding. They exist simultaneously on multiple layers, like marks upon translucent parchment forming a three-dimensional object when viewed together. Rivers of milky white fluid traverse the layers, occasionally pouring through from one to the next. Strange blue globes rain down, birthing horse-sized ticks that hunt for blood. Gelatinous worms crawl through the layers, and forests of tentacled vegetation encrusted with orange moss sway above an amoebic sea. Massive, multi-layered shapes drift at the limit of sight, resembling deep-sea creatures, yet dwarfing entire cities.

## Reality's Distortions

Gravity and time hold no dominion in the Far Realm. Movement between layers requires only a thought, and the air, as viscous as syrup, allows for swimming through its bizarre currents. Powerful entities tear through the layers, creating multi-dimensional holes that act as portals to their infinite domains. These otherworldly openings, perceived as planet-sized spheres by non-aberrant minds, transport beings to realms beyond comprehension.

## Subjectivity of Distance and Time

In this maddening realm, distance and time are but subjective illusions. Two steps may traverse great lengths, while years of travel could be needed to reach the end of a ship. The Far Realm challenges the very fabric of reality, where the line between existence and non-existence blurs, and the mind becomes a fragile vessel navigating the tumultuous seas of insanity. Those who dare to explore its depths must tread carefully, for the Far Realm holds secrets that could shatter the very foundations of the known multiverse.
