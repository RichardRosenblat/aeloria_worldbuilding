# The Greater Limit: The End of the Universe

In the vast and uncharted expanses of the [[Astral Sea]] lies a phenomenon of unparalleled wonder and importance – "The Greater Limit." This colossal, iridescent wall of pearlescent crystal stands as the ultimate safeguard against the encroaching chaos that dwells in the far reaches of [[Non-realities]] and [[The Far Realm]]. At the very precipice of reality itself, The Greater Limit is more than a physical barrier; it is a symbol of the delicate balance that underpins the entire world.

## The Crystal Guardian

The Greater Limit, a magnificent creation, captivates the imagination of adventurers as they venture to the farthest reaches of the [[Astral Sea]]. This crystalline expanse, unlike anything else in the cosmos, stretches toward infinity, a shimmering spectacle at the end of the [[Astral Plane|astral]] horizon. Adventurers gaze upon this awe-inspiring sight, marveling at the iridescence that dances across its surface like the play of ethereal lights.

Crafted by the divine hands of [[Aena, goddess of kindness, creation and order - The Architect (LG)|Aena]] and [[Kryela, goddess of malice, destruction and chaos - The Undoing (CE)|Kryela]], two [[Over-Deities]] of unparalleled power, The Greater Limit serves a crucial purpose in the cosmic tapestry. It is a guardian, a crystalline shield meticulously woven to protect the mortal realm from the eldritch terrors and creeping insanity that lie beyond its pearlescent surface.

## The Unyielding Barrier

No magic, no material, no force, however formidable, can leave a mark upon The Greater Limit. It is an unchangeable entity, impervious to the whims of both mortal and cosmic forces. As adventurers draw near, the shimmering surface seems to repel any attempts at alteration. The crystalline structure radiates an aura of absolute resilience, serving as an unyielding barrier between the known realms and the unfathomable mysteries that lie beyond.

## Divine Architects

[[Aena, goddess of kindness, creation and order - The Architect (LG)|Aena]] and [[Kryela, goddess of malice, destruction and chaos - The Undoing (CE)|Kryela]], the masterminds behind this celestial creation, imbued The Greater Limit with a divine purpose – a manifestation of their incomprehensible love for their creation. The crystalline structure reflects the overpowering intent of these [[Over-Deities]], a testament to the enduring nature of history and the subtle transformations that weave through the fabric of the universe.

## The Shimmering Boundary

As adventurers approach The Greater Limit, they witness the boundary between reality and the chaotic [[The Far Realm|far realm]]. The surface of the crystal sphere shimmers with otherworldly energies, distorting the fabric of space and time. Wisps of white and gray dance across its surface, embodying the emotions of those who crafted it – love, sacrifice, and the unwavering commitment to preserving the delicate balance of existence.

## The Metalogical Barrier

The Greater Limit is not merely a physical obstruction; it is a Metalogical barrier that transcends the limitations of the mortal plane. Beyond its shimmering surface lies the enigmatic realm known as [[The Far Realm]] and the [[Non-realities]], places of incomprehensible horrors. The crystalline expanse stands as the last bastion, preventing the encroachment of madness into the realms of reality.

In the hearts of adventurers, The Greater Limit becomes a constant reminder of the exploration that awaits them. As they sail through the [[Astral Sea]], the crystalline guardian guides their journey, symbolizing the delicate equilibrium between continuity and change, the enduring past, and the ever-transforming future in the tapestry of existence.

## Reflective Meditation

Deep within the confines of The Greater Limit, where the crystalline expanse meets the shimmering boundary of the [[Astral Sea]], lies a mystical practice known as Reflective Meditation. Adventurers who choose to meditate upon the reflective surface of the pearlescent crystal can unlock powerful visions of the past, glimpses into the future, and access to invaluable insights and secrets. However, the path to enlightenment is fraught with peril, as the reflections have the potential to exact a toll on the minds and bodies of those who seek the mysteries held within.

### The Ritual of Reflective Meditation

As adventurers settle into the meditative posture, their gaze fixed upon the shimmering reflection, they initiate the Ritual of Reflective Meditation. Once per short or long rest, a creature can dedicate a significant amount of time to this ritual. The practitioner must make a Wisdom saving throw with a DC of 23, representing the mental fortitude required to delve into the cosmic depths of The Greater Limit's reflective surface.

If the creature succeeds in the Wisdom saving throw, they are rewarded with the desired information. The reflections become vivid and revealing, granting the meditator powerful visions of the past, glimpses into potential futures, useful insights, and access to secret knowledge. In rare instances, the [[Over-Deities]] [[Aena, goddess of kindness, creation and order - The Architect (LG)|Aena]] and [[Kryela, goddess of malice, destruction and chaos - The Undoing (CE)|Kryela]] might extend an invitation to an audience, imparting divine wisdom to those deemed worthy.

On a success, you can determine if the creature receives the desired information or you can roll on the positives outcomes to determine what other effect may happen at the end of the meditation

However, failure in the Reflective Meditation can lead to adverse effects. The reflections may become too intense, causing mental and physical strain. Creatures who fail the saving throw risk falling prey to the adverse effects, ranging from becoming Nothics – beings caught between the realms of sanity and madness – to having their minds shattered, their magical abilities disrupted, or even facing the creation of malevolent mirror images determined to thwart their every move.

On a failure, you can determine if the creature simply does not obtain the desired information or you can roll on the negative outcomes to determine what other effect may happen at the end of the meditation, all effects can be healed by divine intervention or a wish spell

### Supreme Blessings: True Divine Favor

In exceedingly rare occurrences, those who undertake the arduous task of meditating within the confines of The Greater Limit may find themselves graced with the ultimate favor of the [[Over-Deities]].

| **1. Meta-dynamic Resonance**   | The meditator gains the ability to generate their own existence meta-dynamic energy, being able to expand their domain as an action and create a separate domain with a specific effect. This domain encompasses 30ft, and all attacks made by the domain creator are automatic hits and any saving throw is failed. For the effects of the domain, the creator of the domain can select a specific spell of 7th level or lower that they can cast and have the required spell slots at the moment of creation of the domain and cause it's effects to be caused to all creatures inside of it each turn, concentration cannot be broken with the domain's spell. The domain lasts for 1 minute or until the user is rendered unconsious. |
| **2. Elemental Spell Reversal** | The meditator gains the ability to generate positive and negative meta-elemental energy, spending double the amount of spell slots to reverse the effect of a spell they will cast. If the user does not have enough spell slots, the spell will simply cast as normal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

**Supreme Rejection: Divine Hatred**

In exceedingly unfortunate instances, those who dare to delve into Reflective Meditation within The Greater Limit may find themselves facing the wrathful disapproval of the [[Over-Deities]]. When an individual suffers a critical failure in the saving throw during their meditation, they inadvertently incur the displeasure of [[Aena, goddess of kindness, creation and order - The Architect (LG)|Aena]] and [[Kryela, goddess of malice, destruction and chaos - The Undoing (CE)|Kryela]]. Instead of accessing the regular Meditation Outcome table, these unfortunate souls are subjected to the harrowing effects of Supreme Rejection. Here, malevolent curses and dire consequences await, as the divine beings manifest their disdain through punishing trials and afflictions.

| **1. Meta-dynamic Banishment** | mic act of Meta-dynam  The existence of the meditator is flicked by [[Aena, goddess of kindness, creation and order - The Architect (LG)\|Aena, The Architect]]. This cosmic act of Meta-dynamic Banishment hurls the body and soul of the condemned beyond The Greater Limit, hurtling them into the [[The Far Realm\|far realms]]. There, they become vulnerable to eldritch beings beyond comprehension, subjected to untold horrors and torment for eternity. The condemned soul is forever lost, unable to be resurrected or brought back from the abyssal depths of the [[The Far Realm\|Far Realms]], consigned to a fate of eternal oblivion and despair.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **2. Enhollowment**            | The meditator's very essence is cursed by [[Kryela, goddess of malice, destruction and chaos - The Undoing (CE)|Kryela, The Undoing]], plunging them into a state of Enhollowment. In this dire condition, their soul and body are afflicted, rendering them frail and vulnerable to the whims of malevolent forces. Three of their six ability scores are ravaged, diminishing to a pitiful score of 1 forever. Their physical form weakens as well, with their hit points permanently halved, leaving them teetering on the brink of mortality and their body receives 3 points of exhaustion that can only be removed by a wish spell. Moreover, their soul is hollowed, leaving them susceptible to possessions, mind control, and the machinations of dark entities. Should the meditator meet their demise, their soul is condemned to the maw of the [[Over-Deities\|Over-Deity]], where it is devoured and obliterated for eternity, leaving no hope of resurrection or redemption. |
