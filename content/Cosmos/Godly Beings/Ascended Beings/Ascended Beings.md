# Ascended Beings: Mortals Touched by Divinity

Ascended Beings are mortal individuals who have undergone a transformative process, attaining a connection to the divine. These beings wield immense powers granted by [[True Gods]], either willingly or through unauthorized stealing of divine power.

## Transformation and Divine Power

Ascended Beings walk among the material world, bound to mortal shells while channeling divine power. This power can be willingly granted by [[True Gods]], but historical instances reveal that unauthorized siphoning is more common. Those who obtain this divine energy often lead secluded lives, fearing persecution from followers of the [[True Gods|true god]] whose power was siphoned.

## The Fragile Existence

Upon the death of an Ascended Being, a unique dilemma unfolds. Their divine essence attempts to follow their soul, but the absence of fusion with the [[divine spark]] leads to a tragic fate. The spark erodes the soul, rendering it irretrievable by any means, including divine intervention or powerful spells like the wish spell. The essence dissolves, returning the divine power to the original [[True Gods|true god]].

## Kindling [[Divine Spark]]

The [[divine spark]] within Ascended Beings is not a original [[divine spark]] but a weakened, stolen reflection of the god's true power. Referred to as the "Kindling [[Divine Spark]]," it grants immense power to the Ascended, albeit limited compared to the god's true might.

## Limitations and Attributes

Ascended Beings, though powerful, operate within constraints. Their attributes are heightened to inhuman levels, yet they only wield a fraction of the god's true power. Those who siphon power gain dominion over specific aspects of the god's domain. For example, an Ascended Being linked to [[Melora, Goddess of the Wild and Sea - The Wildmother (N)|the Wildmother]] might control the winds.

## Divine Awareness

Despite the vast power difference, gods remain aware of Ascended Beings who siphon their power. The god's strength is only minimally weakened during the process, and they possess knowledge of the Ascended Being's location, unless magically concealed. Even under magical concealment, every use of the Ascended Being's power alerts the god to their actions.
