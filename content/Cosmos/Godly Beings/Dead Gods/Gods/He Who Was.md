# He Who Was: A Vanished Divinity

In the records of [[Aeloria]]'s history, there exists a mysterious and enigmatic figure known only as He Who Was. The very essence of this [[True Gods|True God]] has been veiled in the shroud of time, with no remnants of a name to echo through the ages.

## The Lost Identity

He Who Was once held a divine position among the pantheon, presiding over aspects of existence now obscured by the passage of eons. However, the threads of memory that could unveil the true nature of this deity have been severed. [[Asmodeus, God of Tyranny - The Lord of the Nine Hells (LE)|Asmodeus]], a cunning servant turned god, orchestrated a betrayal so profound that it erased not only He Who Was from the celestial tapestry but also any knowledge that could unravel the god's identity.

## Whispers in the Shadows

Legends and whispers persist, hinting at He Who Was's role in the cosmic order and the influence once wielded over the realms of [[Aeloria]]. Tales speak of a deity whose power and significance rivaled the celestial forces that shaped the world. However, the truth remains elusive, buried beneath the deliberate obfuscation enacted by [[Asmodeus, God of Tyranny - The Lord of the Nine Hells (LE)|Asmodeus]].

## The Void in [[Aeloria]]'s History

He Who Was left an indelible mark on the fabric of [[Aeloria]], but it is a mark defined by absence. The absence of a name, a legacy, and a divine presence that once resonated through the cosmos now stolen. The void left in the wake of this forgotten deity is a testament to the ruthlessness of [[Asmodeus, God of Tyranny - The Lord of the Nine Hells (LE)|Asmodeus]]'s betrayal and the lengths to which the entity went to erase the very existence of He Who Was.

## Speculation and Uncertainty

The few fragments that survived the divine purging only serve to fuel speculation. Was He Who Was an architect of creation, a harbinger of destruction, or something altogether different? The answers lie hidden in the shadows of [[Aeloria]]'s history, waiting to be uncovered by those daring enough to seek the truth behind the god who once was but now is lost to the ages.

## The Obscured Demise

The circumstances surrounding He Who Was's demise are veiled in shadows, lost to the orchestrated erasure enacted by [[Asmodeus, God of Tyranny - The Lord of the Nine Hells (LE)|Asmodeus]]. Whether He Who Was fell in battle, succumbed to treachery, or met his end in some other cosmic tragedy remains a mystery. The only certainty is that his death, like his life, has been carefully concealed, leaving [[Aeloria]] with a void in its history where the details of a god's final moments should have been. The enigma of He Who Was persists, an unresolved chapter in the celestial narrative of [[Aeloria]].
