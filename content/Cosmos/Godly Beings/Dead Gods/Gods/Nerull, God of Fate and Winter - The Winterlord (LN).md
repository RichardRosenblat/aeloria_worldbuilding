# Nerull, the Winterlord

## The [[True Gods|True God]] of Fate and Winter

In the Records of [[Aeloria]]'s divine history, Nerull stands as a formidable deity, presiding over the domains of fate and winter. His influence reached far and wide, casting a chilling shadow on the mortal realm.

### Enigmatic Deity

Nerull's presence and nature remain shrouded in mystery. His realm extended across the icy grasp of winter and the inevitability of fate. Mortals revered and feared the Winterlord, recognizing the inexorable nature of his dominion.

### Little Information

However, the narrative surrounding Nerull is marked by ambiguity and gaps. There exists scant information about the Winterlord, and the records are clouded by the extraordinary events that transpired during the ascension of the [[Raven Queen, Goddess of Death, Crows and Winter - The Matron of Death (LN)|Raven Queen]].

## The Ascension and the Snuffing of Nerull's Spark

### [[Raven Queen, Goddess of Death, Crows and Winter - The Matron of Death (LN)|Raven Queen]]'s Ritual

In a momentous and daring ritual, a mortal sorceress aspired to transcend her mortality and claim divinity. This ambitious act unfolded during [[The New World (Mythical)#The Era of Ascensions (EA)|The Healing Times]] when the world was broken, and magic ran rampant. The ritual, intended for her ascension, inadvertently led to the snuffing out of Nerull's [[divine spark]].

### Winterlord's Fateful End

The ascension of the [[Raven Queen, Goddess of Death, Crows and Winter - The Matron of Death (LN)|Raven Queen]] saw the Winterlord losing his grip over the domains. The very essence that defined Nerull was absorbed and transformed by the newfound goddess, altering the cosmic balance and reshaping the divine order.

## Legacy and Ambiguous Existence

### The Void in Divine Knowledge

As a consequence of the [[Raven Queen, Goddess of Death, Crows and Winter - The Matron of Death (LN)|Raven Queen]]'s ascension, Nerull's legacy is marked by a void in divine knowledge. The Winterlord, once a formidable force in the pantheon, now occupies a place of uncertainty and obscurity.

### The Taken Domains

The domains once governed by Nerull are now intertwined with the essence of the [[Raven Queen, Goddess of Death, Crows and Winter - The Matron of Death (LN)|Raven Queen]]. His domain of Winter now bears the mark of [[Raven Queen, Goddess of Death, Crows and Winter - The Matron of Death (LN)|the Matron of Death]], leaving Nerull's legacy as a spectral echo in the divine tapestry.

In the wake of these transformative events, [[Aeloria]] finds itself grappling with the aftermath of Nerull's snuffed spark and the rise of a new deity, forever altering the course of divine history.
