# The Fate of Gods: Death and Beyond

## The [[Divine Spark]]

In the vast tapestry of [[Aeloria]]'s cosmology, gods wield immense power and influence, but even they are not beyond the reach of mortality. To truly kill a god, one must target their essenceâ€”the [[divine spark]] that fuels their existence. This ethereal core encapsulates the very essence of a deity, and severing it from their being is the only means to bring about their demise.

## The Aftermath of Godly Death

### Petrified Divinity

When a god meets their ultimate end, their corporeal form does not disintegrate into nothingness. Instead, it undergoes a profound transformation, turning into what is known as "dead stone." These petrified remnants retain the divine essence but lose the vitality that once animated them.

### Drifting through Realms

The petrified bodies of deceased gods do not remain tethered to the mortal plane. Instead, they float away into the vastness of the realms where the gods once held sway. Whether it be the enigmatic [[The Far Realm|Far Realms]], the cosmic expanse of [[Solar System|wildspace]], or the endless [[Astral Sea]], these lifeless stones become silent witnesses to the realms they once shaped.

## The Implications of Godly Demise

The death of a god reverberates across the cosmos, leaving an indelible mark on the divine order. The absence of a deity creates a vacuum that can alter the balance of power, influence mortal affairs, and reshape the very fabric of reality. The petrified remnants serve as somber reminders of the gods' mortal vulnerability and the consequences that unfold when godly beings face their ultimate demise.

Yet, even in death, the cycle of divine existence holds a glimmer of hope. Powerful rituals, devoted followers, and the benevolent will of [[Over-Deities|the Twin Goddesses]] themselves can potentially breathe new life into a fallen deity. With their guidance and permission, a new [[divine spark]] may be given or created, allowing the once-dead god to return to the celestial pantheon, marking a rare instance of divine rebirth.
