# Over-Deities in [[Aeloria]]

"Darkness without light is an abyss. Light without darkness is blinding. You cannot have a coin with only one side." - High priestess Alynn, when asked about Aena and Kryela.

## Introduction to Over-Deities

In the expansive realm of [[Aeloria]], over-deities stand as cosmic entities that transcend the hierarchy of [[True Gods]], possessing power beyond mortal and divine comprehension. These beings, also known as over-powers, exist outside the conventional cosmology and are venerated by other deities, demonstrating an unparalleled influence on the very fabric of existence.

## Characteristics of Over-Deities

Over-deities are not confined to a specific plane; instead, they exist ubiquitously, their essence interwoven with the entirety of reality. While they may be worshiped, their direct interaction with mortals is a rarity, occurring perhaps once in a millennium. These entities are bound to the very concept of existence, and all that exists unknowingly worships them.

### [[Divine Spark|Axiomatic Nullity]]

Over-deities themselves do not carry a [[Divine spark]], although they carry in their core something called [[Divine Spark|Axiomatic Nullity]] that works as the foundation of their being in a similar way as [[Divine Spark|Divine sparks]] work for godly beings.

At the core of the Twin Goddesses, [[Aena, goddess of kindness, creation and order - The Architect (LG)|Aena]] and [[Kryela, goddess of malice, destruction and chaos - The Undoing (CE)|Kryela]], lies the [[Divine Spark|Axiomatic Nullity]], a concept woven from the fabric of mathematical paradoxes. This intense nothingness, akin to a mathematical singularity, resonates with the essence of Imaginary numbers, transcending the boundaries of conventional reality. Within the [[Divine Spark|Axiomatic Nullity]], the concept of Null takes on a profound significance, representing not absence, but an overwhelming presence of non-being that births existence through its very negation.

This paradoxical nature finds expression in the Limit of infinite dimensions, a ceaseless expansion that grows into itself until it reverts, creating a confined infinite existence. The [[Divine Spark|Axiomatic Nullity]] functions as a cosmic mathematical Function, an ever-repeating cycle that negates itself to birth existence and, in turn, negates that existence to return to the infinite void. It is a mathematical enigma, a self-referential abstraction that defies conventional understanding.

The [[Divine Spark|Axiomatic Nullity]]'s intense nothingness, existing at the intersection of mathematical abstraction and cosmic reality, mirrors a perpetual dance of creation and destruction. As this profound nothingness grows into itself, reverting and restarting the cycle, it shapes the very foundation of [[Aena, goddess of kindness, creation and order - The Architect (LG)|Aena]] and [[Kryela, goddess of malice, destruction and chaos - The Undoing (CE)|Kryela]]'s divine might, a paradoxical wellspring from which their influence emanates, weaving the cosmic tapestry with the threads of infinite dimensions and unending mathematical intricacies.


### Mind-Breaking Effect of Over-Deities

Beholding the presence of over-deities, be by communing with their raw essence or by some way travelling past the [[The Greater Limit]],  induces a profound and catastrophic rupture in the fabric of a mortal’s mind, distorting their perception across time and space. This mental fragmentation results in individuals involuntarily speaking disjointed phrases—echoes of conversations spanning eons. These utterances, seemingly random, range from eerily nonsensical to cosmically profound, reflecting the vast temporal spectrum of existence. The rupture obliterates coherent thought, embedding fragments of dialogues from all eras into the afflicted mind, rendering the individual a vessel for the voices of countless pasts. This phenomenon underscores the incomprehensible power of over-deities, whose mere unmediated presence can transcend mortal comprehension and reality itself

Never one without the other." - The teaching repeated by the followers of the Twin Goddesses.

### The Nature of [[Aena, goddess of kindness, creation and order - The Architect (LG)|Aena]] and [[Kryela, goddess of malice, destruction and chaos - The Undoing (CE)|Kryela]]

[[Aena, goddess of kindness, creation and order - The Architect (LG)]], and [[Kryela, goddess of malice, destruction and chaos - The Undoing (CE)]], embody opposing forces. Together, they represent the dual embodiment of immutable law, the eternal interplay of two extremes in every instance of space and time.

### Powers and Influence

[[Aena, goddess of kindness, creation and order - The Architect (LG)|Aena]] and [[Kryela, goddess of malice, destruction and chaos - The Undoing (CE)|Kryela]], often referred to as The Twin Goddesses, possess near eldritch powers almost beyond comprehension. They are not bound by conventional notions of good or evil, instead embodying the principles of creation and destruction that shape reality itself. Their overwhelming influence extends throughout [[Aeloria]], and even the [[True Gods]] acknowledge their supremacy.

## Religious Practices

1. **Harmonic Rituals:** Devotees engage in rituals that symbolize the harmonious balance between creation and destruction.
