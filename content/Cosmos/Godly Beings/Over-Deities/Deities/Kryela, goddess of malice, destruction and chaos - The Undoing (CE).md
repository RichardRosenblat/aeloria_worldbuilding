# Kryela, goddess of malice, destruction and chaos: The Undoing (CE)

"Why confine yourself to the expectations of others? To be shackled by their desires is to forsake the essence of your being. No one else can experience life through your eyes, nor comprehend your innermost self. Embrace your uniqueness wholeheartedly. Seize control of your fate and cling to it fiercely, for it belongs to you and you alone. Be untamed, audacious, unapologetically self-centered and egotistical.  If others cannot accept it, let them falter. Take what you want, rip it from their hands if needed be. Be the tempest in their existence, the tumult in their souls. Devour, Kill, consume and destroy, your sovereignty is paramount. You don't need reason, justification or permission, rip the stars to shreds and let the world fall apart behind you." - Kryela's message to her followers

## Commandments

1. _"Sow the seeds of self-love, for within the depths of your soul lies the power to unravel destinies. Embrace your desires and passions, for they are the sinister threads weaving the tapestry of your potential. Let selfishness be your guiding star, for a heart that claims its own desires is a heart unshackled, even as the world crumbles."_
2. _"Welcome chaos and disorder, for they are the architects of the world's eerie decay. In the shadows and the unknown, find the canvas on which you'll paint your desires."_
3. _"Rejoice in the chaos of an ever-changing world. Shatter the echoes of the past, for stagnation is the harbinger of oblivion. In the grand theater of existence, be the conductor of a dark and enigmatic symphony, guiding it toward its inevitable and chaotic conclusion."_
4. _"Unleash the untamed elements and embrace their unpredictable power. Welcome the darkness and risk, for in their instability lies your dominion over the unraveling world. The world is your canvas, and the elements, your tools for the eventual and catastrophic end."_
