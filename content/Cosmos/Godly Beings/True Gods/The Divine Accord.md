# The Divine Accord: Cosmic Harmonic Law

## Emergence of the Accord

In response to [[The Great War (GW)|tumultuous conflicts]] among [[True Gods]] and the chaotic repercussions of their actions on the mortal realm, the Divine Accord emerged as a celestial covenant. Crafted in the heart of [[the Eternal Workshop]], this accord was a testament to the necessity of structured divine interaction with the mortal realm.

### Origins and Creators

Conceived in the midst of cosmic strife, the Divine Accord was forged by [[Aena, goddess of kindness, creation and order - The Architect (LG)|Aena]] and [[Kryela, goddess of malice, destruction and chaos - The Undoing (LE)|Kryela]], [[Over-Deities|the cosmic dreamers]] who birthed [[Aeloria]]. Recognizing the need for order and balance, these [[Over-Deities|The Twin Goddesses]] established the accord to guide the interactions of the pantheon and shape the destiny of their creation.

## Laws of the Divine Accord

### 1. Immutable Veil
The [[True Gods]], bound by the Immutable Veil, must abstain from direct involvement in mortal affairs and the [[Material Plane|Prime Material]], confining their realms to the [[Metapsychic Planes]]. This cosmic decree ensures the autonomy of mortal beings, allowing them to shape their destinies free from divine coercion. The [[True Gods]], as silent observers, embrace the beauty of unpredictability and resilience in mortal lives.
### 2. Mortal Champions
Mandated by the accord, [[True Gods]] must appoint mortal champions as emissaries of their divine will. These champions, chosen by the [[True Gods]], serve as conduits between the divine and mortal realms, embodying the ideals of their patrons. Divine powers bestowed upon champions manifest the will of the [[True Gods]] through mortal agency.
## 3. Domain Boundaries
From the inception of the Divine Accord onwards, [[True Gods]] shall bind themselves to specific domains of reality, intertwining their essence with the fabric of reality. Henceforth, any harm inflicted upon their designated domain shall reverberate within their divine essence, and vice versa, creating an inseparable bond between deity and domain. While [[True Gods]] may exert limited influence within their domains in the [[Material Plane|Prime Material]] and beyond, such actions must not contravene any other law of the Divine Accord.
### 4. Domain Custodianship Accord
In eternal commitment, [[True Gods]] faithfully represent and uphold their designated domains, respecting the autonomy of fellow [[True Gods|deities]]. The accord fosters collaboration, allowing diverse divine realms to coexist harmoniously within the intricate tapestry of [[Aeloria]].
### 5. Harmony of Chaos and Order
The [[True Gods]] shall acknowledge and embrace the inherent duality of chaos and order within the cosmos. Balancing innovation and stability, the [[True Gods]] strive to maintain harmony between these vital cosmic forces.
### 6. Dual Nature of Morality
Recognizing the dual nature of morality, [[True Gods]] refrain from imposing their will over mortals or beings in the [[material plane]]. Free will guides choices, allowing them to navigate the intricate web of morality, while the [[True Gods]] observe without undue interference.
### 7. Eternal Dance of Creation and Destruction
Honoring the eternal dance of creation and destruction, [[True Gods]] refrain from hindering this natural cycle. Creation breathes life into the world, and destruction paves the way for new beginnings, shaping the destiny of the cosmos.
### 8. Multiplicity of Perspectives
[[True Gods|Deities]] respect the multiplicity of mortal perspectives, refraining from imposing a singular truth. The diversity of beliefs, cultures, and individual journeys is celebrated, allowing mortals to navigate their paths freely.
### 9. Ever-Flowing River of Time
[[True Gods]] understand the interconnected nature of past, present, and future. Refraining from undue manipulation of temporal threads, they allow the river of time to shape the destiny of [[Aeloria]], witnessing the consequences of their divine interventions.
### 10. Manifestation of Elemental Equilibrium
Upholding the elemental equilibrium, [[True Gods]] revere and utilize elemental forces responsibly. Excessive interference may lead to affliction, and [[True Gods]] guide mortals in understanding the intricate dance of the elements.
### 11. Unity in Diversity
[[True Gods|Deities]] champion unity in diversity, inspiring mortals to appreciate the richness brought by differences. Unity arises from the harmonious interplay of diverse elements, fostering a collective unity that transcends individual disparities.
### 12. Empowered Devotion
In a reciprocal bond, [[True Gods]] amplify their divine influence and power in response to the genuine worship and unwavering devotion of mortals. As believers dedicate themselves to the divine principles, the gods, in turn, grant heightened powers to those who earnestly seek their guidance. 
### 13. Multiplicity of Self
[[True Gods]] shall manifest themselves in various forms and representations. These manifestations, must be amalgamations of their own desire and the intricate tapestry made by cultures and beliefs of their worshippers. In addition to their representations, [[True Gods]] shall maintain an incorporeal self that transcends physical forms as patterns of self, ensuring a connection with the essence of their being. This incorporeal aspect serves as a bridge between the divine and mortal realms, allowing for a dynamic and ever-evolving relationship shaped by the multiplicity of selves within [[Aeloria]].

## Purpose and Impact

Crafted as a response to divine conflicts, the Divine Accord guides [[True Gods]] in shaping [[Aeloria]]'s destiny. It ensures a structured approach to divine-mortal interactions, fostering cosmic harmony and allowing mortals to thrive in a realm shaped by both free will and divine influence.

## Absolute Unbreakable Nature of the Divine Accord

The Divine Accord stands as an immutable decree, woven into the very fabric of existence by the [[Over-Deities]] themselves. Its tenets are not merely guidelines but absolute laws that govern the interactions between [[True Gods]] and mortals. Such is the profound influence of the accord that it transcends mere obedience; it alters the very essence of divine consciousness. The minds of the [[True Gods]] have been shaped by its divine mandate to the extent that the notion of violating the accord becomes inconceivable. It is as if the concept of defying the will of the [[Over-Deities]] has been erased from their celestial comprehension, rendering any thought of transgression utterly incomprehensible. Thus, the Divine Accord stands as an unbreakable barrier, ensuring cosmic order and harmony for eternity.

## Cataclysmic Consequences of Accord Destruction

Should the unthinkable come to pass, and the Divine Accord be sundered by the hand of the [[Over-Deities]] themselves, the consequences would reverberate throughout the cosmos with cataclysmic intensity. With the shackles of the accord broken, the [[True Gods]] would regain their unfettered power to directly influence the [[material plane]]. No longer bound by the constraints of cosmic law, they would wield their divine might to shape the mortal realms according to their whims and desires. The delicate balance maintained by the accord would collapse, plunging [[Aeloria]] into a tumultuous era of divine intervention and chaos. Mortals would find themselves at the mercy of capricious deities, their fates no longer their own but subject to the whims of the divine. Such a scenario would herald a new age of uncertainty and upheaval, where the very fabric of reality hangs in the balance.

In the aftermath of the Divine Accord's destruction, the [[True Gods]] would not only regain their ability to directly influence the [[material plane]] but also exert control beyond the confines of their designated domains. With their powers unbound, they would possess the capacity to sculpt cosmic bodies on a scale rivaling the heavens themselves, reshaping the very fabric of reality at will. Furthermore, they would wield the authority to create mortal bodies, imbued with divine essence, to serve as vessels through which they could exercise dominion over mortal civilizations. This unchecked omnipotence would grant the [[True Gods]] unparalleled control over the fate of [[Aeloria]], ushering in an era where the boundaries between mortals and divinity blur, and the cosmos itself becomes their playground of limitless potential.
