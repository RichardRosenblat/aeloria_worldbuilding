# The Divine Accord: Cosmic Harmonic Law

## Emergence of the Accord

In response to tumultuous conflicts among [[True Gods]] and the chaotic repercussions of their actions on the mortal realm, the Divine Accord emerged as a celestial covenant. Crafted in the heart of [[the Eternal Workshop]], this accord was a testament to the necessity of structured divine interaction with the mortal realm.

### Origins and Creators

Conceived in the midst of cosmic strife, the Divine Accord was forged by [[Aena, goddess of kindness, creation and order - The Architect (LG)|Aena]] and [[Kryela, goddess of malice, destruction and chaos - The Undoing (LE)|Kryela]], [[Over-Deities|the cosmic dreamers]] who birthed [[Aeloria]]. Recognizing the need for order and balance, these [[Over-Deities|The Twin Goddesses]] established the accord to guide the interactions of the pantheon and shape the destiny of their creation.

## Laws of the Divine Accord

### 1. Immutable Veil
The [[True Gods]], bound by the Immutable Veil, must abstain from direct involvement in mortal affairs. This cosmic decree ensures the autonomy of mortal beings, allowing them to shape their destinies free from divine coercion. The [[True Gods]], as silent observers, embrace the beauty of unpredictability and resilience in mortal lives.
### 2. Mortal Champions
Mandated by the accord, [[True Gods]] must appoint mortal champions as emissaries of their divine will. These champions, chosen by the [[True Gods]], serve as conduits between the divine and mortal realms, embodying the ideals of their patrons. Divine powers bestowed upon champions manifest the will of the [[True Gods]] through mortal agency.
### 3. Domain Custodianship Accord
In eternal commitment, [[True Gods]] faithfully represent and uphold their designated domains, respecting the autonomy of fellow [[True Gods|deities]]. The accord fosters collaboration, allowing diverse divine realms to coexist harmoniously within the intricate tapestry of [[Aeloria]].
### 4. Harmony of Chaos and Order
The [[True Gods]] shall acknowledge and embrace the inherent duality of chaos and order within the cosmos. Balancing innovation and stability, the [[True Gods]] strive to maintain harmony between these vital cosmic forces.
### 5. Dual Nature of Morality
Recognizing the dual nature of morality, [[True Gods]] refrain from imposing their will over mortals or beings in the [[material plane]]. Free will guides choices, allowing them to navigate the intricate web of morality, while the [[True Gods]] observe without undue interference.
### 6. Eternal Dance of Creation and Destruction
Honoring the eternal dance of creation and destruction, [[True Gods]] refrain from hindering this natural cycle. Creation breathes life into the world, and destruction paves the way for new beginnings, shaping the destiny of the cosmos.
### 7. Multiplicity of Perspectives
[[True Gods|Deities]] respect the multiplicity of mortal perspectives, refraining from imposing a singular truth. The diversity of beliefs, cultures, and individual journeys is celebrated, allowing mortals to navigate their paths freely.
### 8. Ever-Flowing River of Time
[[True Gods]] understand the interconnected nature of past, present, and future. Refraining from undue manipulation of temporal threads, they allow the river of time to shape the destiny of [[Aeloria]], witnessing the consequences of their divine interventions.
### 9. Manifestation of Elemental Equilibrium
Upholding the elemental equilibrium, [[True Gods]] revere and utilize elemental forces responsibly. Excessive interference may lead to affliction, and [[True Gods]] guide mortals in understanding the intricate dance of the elements.
### 10. Unity in Diversity
[[True Gods|Deities]] champion unity in diversity, inspiring mortals to appreciate the richness brought by differences. Unity arises from the harmonious interplay of diverse elements, fostering a collective unity that transcends individual disparities.

**11. Empowered Devotion**
In a reciprocal bond, [[True Gods]] amplify their divine influence and power in response to the genuine worship and unwavering devotion of mortals. As believers dedicate themselves to the divine principles, the gods, in turn, grant heightened powers to those who earnestly seek their guidance. 

**12. Multiplicity of Self**
[[True Gods]] shall manifest themselves in various forms and representations. These manifestations, must be amalgamations of their own desire and the intricate tapestry made by cultures and beliefs of their worshippers. In addition to their representations, [[True Gods]] shall maintain an incorporeal self that transcends physical forms as patterns of self, ensuring a connection with the essence of their being. This incorporeal aspect serves as a bridge between the divine and mortal realms, allowing for a dynamic and ever-evolving relationship shaped by the multiplicity of selves within [[Aeloria]].

## Secret of the 12th

The original text actually say 
*The honored ones shall manifest themselves in various forms and representations. These manifestations must be amalgamations of their own desire and the intricate tapestry made by cultures and beliefs of those who speak to them. In addition to these representations, these beings shall maintain an incorporeal self that transcends physical forms as patterns of selfs, ensuring a connection with the essence of their being. This incorporeal aspect serves as a bridge between the abstract and tangible realms, allowing for a dynamic and ever-evolving relationship shaped by the multiplicity of selves within the realm.*
