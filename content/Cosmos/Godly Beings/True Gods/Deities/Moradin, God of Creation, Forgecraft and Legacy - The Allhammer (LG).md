## Religious Practices

Moradin's followers are known for their dedication to craftsmanship, tradition, and community. They engage in a variety of religious practices and rituals to honor the Allhammer and seek his guidance and blessings. Some of the most common practices include:

1. **Forging Ceremonies:** Devotees of Moradin regularly participate in forging ceremonies where they craft weapons, armor, and other items as offerings to the god. These ceremonies are conducted with solemnity and reverence, with prayers offered to Moradin for guidance and inspiration in their craftsmanship.

2. **Ancestral Remembrance:** Followers of Moradin honor their ancestors through rituals that involve visiting ancestral halls or crypts, offering prayers, and leaving tokens of respect such as crafted items or symbolic representations of the family's legacy. These rituals reinforce the importance of legacy and continuity in dwarven cultures.

3. **Blessing of New Ventures:** Before embarking on significant endeavors such as new mining expeditions, construction projects, or business ventures, followers of Moradin seek the blessing of the Allhammer. This is typically done through a ritual where each individual involved in the venture crafts an item to be given to their loved ones as a token of their commitment to the project and as a token to remember them by during their absence.

4. **Feast of the Founders:** Once a year, followers of Moradin gather for the Feast of the Founders, a celebration honoring the legendary founders of civilization and the divine artisans who shaped the world. The feast is marked by the hunting of giant boars, bears, or other large creatures, and the brewing of special ales and meads to be shared among the community, followed by a grand feast where stories of heroism, craftsmanship, and divine intervention are shared.

5. **Trial by Fire:** When someone wrongs the community or is suspected of treachery, followers of Moradin may invoke the Trial by Fire, a ritual in which the accused must undergo a series of challenges or tests to prove their innocence or, if guilty, to seek redemption through penance. These trials are often witnessed by the community and overseen by a council of elders or priests, as the accused faces struggles that test their courage, resolve, and resilience. Those who pass the trial are welcomed back into the community, while those who fail are cast out or punished accordingly.

6. **Rite of Passage:** When young dwarves reach adulthood, they undergo a Rite of Passage ceremony to mark their transition into full-fledged members of society. This ritual often involves a symbolic journey or task that tests the individual's courage, skill, and commitment to Moradin's values. It can be a pilgrimage to sacred sites, a crafting challenge, or a test of physical endurance, culminating in a ceremony where at the end of the rite the individual is welcomed by their family and community as an adult usually with great fanfare and celebration.

7. **Annual Pilgrimage:** Followers of Moradin may undertake an annual pilgrimage to sacred sites associated with the Allhammer, such as ancient forges, mountain peaks, or divine shrines. During the travels, pilgrims seek must find raw materials to craft a new item or repain an broken one every day of their pilgrimage. They usually travel in groups carrrying the tools of their trade to be able to craft the items they need for the pilgrimage. During the travel the pilgrims must remain silent and stoic, only speaking when necessary or during the crafting of the items. The pilgrimage is a time of reflection, meditation, and renewal, as devotees seek to deepen their connection to Moradin and gain insight into their own purpose and destiny. Those that complete the pilgrimage many years in a row are considered to become incredibly skilled craftsmen and are often sought after for their unparalleled skill. 

8. **Burning offering:** Whenever a follower of Moradin wishes to confess their love, deep respect, and gratitude to another, they must embark on a quest for the perfect gift, one that will endure through generations, unfazed by the passage of time. This quest begins with seeking Moradin's blessing through meditation, ensuring divine guidance in finding the perfect materials, design, and execution. The gift must be crafted by the follower themselves, who must achieve perfection in all aspects, however long it may take. The creation process must be conducted in stoic concentration, allowing the follower to channel their feelings and devotion into the work. Once the gift is completed, the follower presents it to the recipient in a private and significant location. Here, they explain the meaning and emotions behind the gift, but never the crafting process, as the gift must speak for the dedication and effort on its own. The offering must be conducted with utmost respect and reverence. If the recipient accepts the gift, it signifies reciprocation of feelings, forging a bond as strong as the item itself. If the gift is rejected, the follower must accept this with dignity, never speaking of the offering or the feelings behind it again to avoid burdening the recipient with the resposability for the follower's feelings. This ritual is a profound way for followers to express their deepest emotions and create lasting bonds through the power of craftsmanship. Many followers of Moradin spend years searching and crafting the perfect gift, creating intricate and beautiful items. Some inscribe their feelings into the item, others use materials from distant lands, and some imbue their creations with powerful magic and enchantments. Gifts created in this manner often become family heirlooms, symbolizing the enduring bond between giver and recipient.

8. **Hospitality and Generosity:** Generosity and hospitality are important cultural norms. Visitors and guests are treated with strict courtesy and respect, and hosts are expected to provide food, shelter, and protection to those in need.

As a guest, one is expected to show gratitude and respect to their host and their home, and those that do not are rarely welcomed back.

9. **Honoring the Earth and Fire:** Given Moradin's association with creation and the earth, there is a profound respect for nature, particularly mountains, caves, volcanos, magma and underground formations.
