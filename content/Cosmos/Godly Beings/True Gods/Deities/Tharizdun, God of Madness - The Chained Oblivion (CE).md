**Origins and Transformation into the Chained Oblivion:**
- **Protective Deity Turned Mad:** Tharizdun, originally a protective god, succumbed to insanity during a battle against the far realms' forces, seeking to destroy reality instead.
- **Sealing by Aena and Kryela:** Over-deities Aena and Kryela intervened, separating Tharizdun's divine power, physical body, and consciousness to prevent further destruction.
- **The Prisons:** Tharizdun's power resides in krelshi-tranor, a multicolored crystal shard that spans the last layer of the abyss, constantly expanding the abyss itself.
- **Body and Consciousness Prisons:** Tharizdun's colossal body is chained in a prison of iron and hooks, while its consciousness is trapped in a bag of its own skin, eternally distracted.

**Locations and Access to the Prisons:**
- **krelshi-tranor:** Protected by paradoxical defenses, this crystal creates new abyssal layers and spawns demons, serving as the abyss's source.
- **Prison of the Mind:** Accessed through a shifting portal protected by The Cyst, made of porous black stone, in a demiplane at the abyss's end.
- **Prison of the Body:** Found in the [[Yawnohim|Forbidden Lands of Yawnohim]], a hidden plane frozen in time, accessible through a gateway protected by powerful celestials.

**Influence and Manipulation:**
- **Influence on Demons and Mortals:** Tharizdun's dreams and occasional consciousness manipulate demons to guard krelshi-tranor and influence mortals to free it.
- **Portal to Tharizdun:** Accessible through a specific ritual with a key cast into a shallow pool in [[Yawnohim]]'s temple; mishandling the ritual leads to abyssal consequences.

Help me make some lore on Thariuzdun, God of Madness - The Chained Oblivion 

Heres some points i have about it

Tharizdun pronouns are It/its
It was a protective god, but during a battle to protect reality  against the forces of the far realms tharizdun became insane and tried to destroy reality but was stopped by the other gods and sealed by the over-deities Aena and Kryela, the goddesses of opposing powers and mothers of all other gods and reality 
they separated its divine power its physical body and its consiousness so that he couldnt use its powers they casted the prision into the core of their workshop, the farthest place from the far realms so that tharizdun couldnt be influenced by the far realms again
tharizdun power is sealed in the form of a crystal, known as krelshi-tranor the shard of pure madness it is often portraid as a multicolored rough crystal shard 
tharizdun body is sealed in a prision made of chains, hooks, nails and iron plates, a colossal body tied down to the ground with two massive wings behind it
tharizdun consiousness is sealed in a bag made of its own skin sealed in front of the body by chains and hooks keeping the consiousness in a state of eternal distraction being incapable of concentrating on anything
before he was sealed his madness created the obyriths, the first demons 
Krelshti-thranor is a impossibly large crystal that emcompass the entire last layer of the abyss, beyond the infinite layers of the abyss it is protected by the paradox that is reaching its location. The crystal is also constantly creating new layers into the abyss and spewing out demons and other creatures of madness being considered the source of the abyss itself, as it falls down into the abyss it adds new layers to it, the abyss is infinite and constantly expanding
its body and mind's prisions are each in their own a demiplanes at the end of the infinite layers of the abyss
The prison of the mind is mostly impossible to reach, but there is a portal that leads to it, the portal changes location constantly and is protected by an ellipsoidal shape made of porous black stone known as The Cyst
the prison of the body can only be accessed through a plane lost in between the other outer planes, It is called [[Yawnohim|Forbidden Lands of Yawnohim]], it is a plane hidden from all other planes, it has many layers, all of them frozen in time until observed, the very first layer (the only one being with portals leading to the outside) appears as a deserted land with scattered ruins around it, the only way to enter it is through a gateway between hidden mountains that teleports through the astral plane (hidden within minds of various creatures), and elemental planes(hidden among the infinite mountain of the earth plane), the gateway itself is protected by powerful celestials, the gateway connects to a enormous bridge that takes one to a temple in which there is a room sealed by the life force of extremelly powerful constructs around the layers of the [[Yawnohim|forbidden lands of Yawnohim]], needing to slay those creatures to break the seal and give entrance to a shallow pool of water that can be used as the portal to the body of Tharizdun, but to use the portal, one needs to cast a specific key on the pool to open the portal, otherwise it behaves like a mundane pool, if another item is cast into the pool without it being the specific key, the portal opens but leads to a devouring maw within the abyss
through it's dreams and few instances of consiousness, tharizdun causes the demons from the abyss gravitate towards the crystal and influences mortals to do work towards freeing it, that is the only thing that makes the demons stay in the abyss



Tharizdun, driven to madness by the relentless onslaught, tried joining forces with the abominations of the far realm, thus betraying its divine kin. It started working with the forces of the Far Realm to bring about the end of all things, it created a portal to the Far Realms and as the forces of madness poured through, the True Gods and Over-Deities were forced to act. Tharizdun's siblings held it at bay, and in time it was bound by Aena and Kryela deep within the workshop's core with a confinement made of chains, hooks, metal plates and its body was bound within a coffin of its own skin.


The **Forbidden Lands of [[Yawnohim]]** provide an intricate and multi-layered environment, ripe with challenges and hidden secrets. Here is a detailed concept for the portal to Tharizdun's body demiplane within this context:

### The Forbidden Lands of [[Yawnohim]]
- **Plane Description**: A hidden plane, frozen in time until observed, with many layers. The first layer is a desolate land with scattered ruins. 
- **Gateway Access**: The gateway is hidden between mountains, teleporting through the astral and elemental planes. Protected by powerful celestials, it connects to an enormous bridge leading to a temple.

### The Temple
- **Temple Description**: Ancient and grand, filled with arcane symbols and guarded by powerful constructs. These constructs are scattered across various layers of the Forbidden Lands.
- **Sealed Room**: The room is sealed by the life force of these constructs. To break the seal, all constructs must be slain, releasing their life force.

### The Pool of Water
- **Shallow Pool**: At the heart of the sealed room, there is a shallow pool of water. This pool acts as the portal to the body demiplane of Tharizdun.
- **Key Mechanism**: The portal only opens correctly when a specific key is cast into the pool. Without this key, the pool behaves mundanely. If the wrong item is cast, the portal leads to a devouring maw within the abyss.

### Specific Key
- **Key Description**: A unique artifact, possibly an ancient relic tied to Tharizdun's lore. The key could be a fragment of his divine power, a shard of his essence, or an artifact blessed (or cursed) by his followers.
- **Key Location**: The key itself could be hidden in another challenging location, possibly guarded by ancient traps or powerful guardians. 

### Layers of the Forbidden Lands
1. **Deserted Ruins**: The initial layer, with scattered ruins and remnants of an ancient civilization.
2. **Frozen Forest**: A forest frozen in time, with trees and creatures suspended in motion.
3. **Ethereal Plains**: Open plains with ethereal, ghostly apparitions moving in slow motion.
4. **Crystal Caverns**: Caverns filled with time-frozen crystals that pulse with latent energy.
5. **Celestial Sanctuary**: A sanctuary guarded by celestials, containing powerful artifacts and secrets.
6. **Arcane Tower**: A towering structure filled with arcane traps and puzzles, protecting ancient knowledge.

### Guardian Constructs
- **Constructs**: Each layer is guarded by powerful constructs that need to be defeated to break the seal on the room.
- **Construct Types**: These could range from stone golems and animated armor to more exotic creatures like living statues imbued with elemental power.

### The Journey
- **Starting Point**: Seekers must first find the gateway between hidden mountains, guarded by celestials.
- **Bridge to Temple**: Cross the enormous bridge leading to the temple, overcoming obstacles and guardians.
- **Breaking the Seal**: Explore the various layers of the Forbidden Lands, defeating the guardian constructs to release their life force and break the seal.
- **Using the Pool**: Cast the specific key into the pool to open the portal correctly. Any other item results in being devoured by a maw within the abyss.

This concept provides a rich, layered adventure for players, requiring them to explore, solve puzzles, and defeat powerful foes to reach Tharizdun's body demiplane.
