# Kord, God of Strength and Storms - The Stormlord (CN)

"Fear seldom is reason enough to not act. Fear is a challenge to be overcome, a mountain to be climbed, a foe to fall before you. Once you have conquered fear, you will use it as a weapon, a tool and a shield." - Teachings passed down by followers of Kord

## Religious Practices

1. **Thunderous Chants:** Followers gather in temples or open spaces to chant hymns and prayers dedicated to Kord, accompanied by rhythmic drumming and clapping to mimic the sound of thunderstorms. These chants invoke the strength and courage of the Stormlord, inspiring bravery in the hearts of believers.

2. **Rite of Storm's Blessing:** During times of need or before embarking on a significant endeavor or when facing a great challenge, devotees undergo a ceremonial ritual known as the Rite of Storm's Blessing. This ritual involves standing in an open area, like a mountaintop, a meadow, or a beach, during a thunderstorm and lifting their arms to the sky and hitting their chest, invoking Kord's protection and guidance.

3. **Trial of Thunder:** Initiates seeking to become full-fledged members of the faith must undergo the Trial of Thunder, a physical and mental challenge designed to test their endurance, bravery, and commitment to Kord's teachings. This trial often involves tasks such as climbing treacherous mountains, battling fierce beasts, or enduring battle against fellow aspirants in a test of strength and skill.

4. **Lightning Runes Inscription:** Believers adorn their bodies or personal belongings with symbolic lightning runes, which are believed to offer protection and strength against adversity. These intricate symbols are often inscribed onto weapons, armor, or worn as tattoos, serving as visible reminders of their devotion to Kord.

5. **Great Feast of Thunder:** On special occasions, such as the anniversary of significant victories or celestial alignments, followers gather for the Great Feast of Thunder. This festive celebration includes communal feasting in outdoor settings, the building of bonfires and temporary settlements and shrines that will be the home of those in the feast for the duration of the celebration, displays of martial prowess, strenght and willpower, and the sharing of wisdom and stories of Kord's legendary exploits.

6. **Thunderforging:** Blacksmiths and artisans dedicated to Kord perform the Thunderforging to bless their crafted weapons and armor with divine strength. During this ritual, the smiths work in the midst of a thunderstorm, they grasp in their hands a holy symbol of Kord, dunking them in blessed water before using it to hammer the metal while singing and chanting prayers to the Stormlord. Once the item is completed, it must be tested in battle against a worthy foe to prove its worthiness. This ensures the raw power of Kord is imbued in the weapon or armor.

7. **Storm's Vigil:** During periods of severe weather, believers undertake the Storm's Vigil, a solemn observance dedicated to honoring Kord's mastery over the elements. Participants gather in temples or designated outdoor sanctuaries to meditate, offer prayers for protection, and reflect on the awe-inspiring power of the wind, rain, and lightning. This practice serves as a reminder of the Stormlord's dominion over the natural world and the need for humility and respect in the face of such forces
