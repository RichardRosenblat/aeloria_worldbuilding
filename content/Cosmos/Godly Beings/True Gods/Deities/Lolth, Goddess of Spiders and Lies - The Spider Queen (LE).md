# Lolth, Goddess of Spiders and Lies - The Spider Queen (LE)

"Oh, poor, deluded thing. Your gods have sent you to your doom, knowing full well you could not survive an encounter with me. I see the fear in your eyes, the doubt gnawing at your heart, and the countless lives claimed by your blade in the name of other gods. Do you ponder whether to fall to your knees and worship me? Or perhaps flee in terror? Maybe you hope to cower behind your walls and strongholds? Understand this: the best you can do is beg for mercy, for your gods will not come to your aid. They are the ones who abandoned you to this fate, after all.

Yet I alone see your true potential—the power you could wield, the intricate webs you could weave, the deceit you could master, and the path to greatness that lies before you. So, what will it be, mortal? Will you offer me your love—or your life?"
— Lolth, meeting a paladin.

1. **Matriarchal Society**: Cultures that worship Lolth often exhibit a strong matriarchal social structure, with women holding positions of power and authority within the community. Matron mothers and priestesses serve as leaders and decision-makers, guiding the society according to the will of Lolth. Men are typically subservient to women and may occupy roles such as warriors or laborers, with their status determined by their service to the matriarchy.

2. **Ritualistic Cruelty**: Ritualistic cruelty is often normalized within cultures that venerate Lolth, with acts of violence and depravity seen as acceptable means of demonstrating devotion to the Spider Queen. Torture, sacrifice, and betrayal are common themes in religious ceremonies and social interactions, serving to reinforce the dominance of the strong over the weak and to appease the insatiable appetite of Lolth for suffering.

3. **Intrigue and Betrayal**: Deception, intrigue, and betrayal are valued skills within cultures that worship Lolth, with individuals encouraged to outmaneuver their rivals through cunning and manipulation. Loyalty is fleeting, and alliances are constantly shifting as individuals vie for power and influence within the intricate web of Drow society. Trust is a rare commodity, and paranoia runs deep among the followers of the Spider Queen.

4. **Dark Beauty and Elegance**: Despite their penchant for cruelty and deceit, cultures that worship Lolth often exhibit a fascination with dark beauty and elegance. Adornments such as intricate spider silk garments, jeweled spider motifs, and elaborate face paint are commonly worn as symbols of status and devotion to the Spider Queen. Physical attractiveness is prized, with individuals striving to embody the allure and allure of Lolth herself.

5. **Subjugation of Other Races**: Cultures that venerate Lolth typically view themselves as superior to other species, particularly those who dwell on the surface world. Tallmen, elves, and other surface-dwelling species are often regarded as inferior beings fit only for exploitation. Drow societies may engage in raids and conquests to inprision captives and expand their territories, further reinforcing their dominance over lesser species.

6. **Spider Symbolism and Taboos**: Spider symbolism permeates every aspect of life within cultures that worship Lolth, with spiders revered as sacred creatures and symbols of the Spider Queen's divine presence. Images of spiders adorn temples, artwork, and religious artifacts, serving as reminders of Lolth's dominion over the [[Underdark]]. Conversely, certain taboos and superstitions surround spiders, with killing or harming a spider seen as a sacrilegious act punishable by severe consequences.

7. **Secretive and Isolationist**: Cultures that venerate Lolth tend to be secretive and isolationist, preferring to keep their rituals and traditions hidden from outsiders. Drow societies are often cloistered within the depths of the [[Underdark]], hidden from the prying eyes of surface-dwellers and rival factions. Outsiders are viewed with suspicion and hostility, as potential threats to the fragile balance of power within Drow society.

8. **Obsession with Power and Prestige**: Power and prestige hold immense importance within cultures that worship Lolth, with individuals striving to climb the ranks of society through any means necessary. Achieving status within the priesthood or military is a common goal, with ambitious individuals willing to betray allies and commit unspeakable acts to advance their own agendas. The pursuit of power is relentless, driving followers of Lolth to ever greater heights of ambition and depravity in service to their goddess.

## Political Structures

Cultures that worship Lolth are characterized by complex and often brutal political structures that reflect the values and beliefs of the Spider Queen. These structures are designed to maintain the dominance of the matriarchy, uphold the authority of the priesthood, and ensure the continued supremacy of Lolth's chosen people within the [[Underdark]].

1. **Theocratic Matriarchy**: The primary political structure in Lolth-worshiping cultures is a theocratic matriarchy, where religious leaders, typically high priestesses of Lolth, wield ultimate authority. The society is governed by a hierarchy of matron mothers who oversee various aspects of governance, law, and religious practice, ensuring that all actions align with the decrees of the Spider Queen.

2. **House Hierarchies**: Drow societies are organized into powerful noble houses, each led by a matron mother. These houses operate as both political and familial units, competing with one another for influence and favor from Lolth. The status of a house is determined by its wealth, military strength, and the cunning of its leaders. Alliances and rivalries between houses shape the political landscape, with betrayal and intrigue being common tactics.

3. **Council of Matrons**: At the top of the political hierarchy is the Council of Matrons, composed of the matron mothers of the most powerful houses. This council makes decisions on matters of state, warfare, and religious doctrine. While the council operates under a facade of cooperation, internal power struggles and backstabbing are rife as each matron seeks to elevate her house above the others.

4. **Priestess Class**: The priestesses of Lolth hold significant political power, often acting as advisors to matron mothers and wielding influence over military and civic matters. High priestesses, in particular, are revered and feared, serving as the direct conduits of Lolth's will. Their authority can override even that of noble houses, especially in matters of religious importance.

5. **Military Command**: The military is a crucial aspect of Lolth-worshiping cultures, with a strict hierarchy commanded by female officers. The highest-ranking military leader is often a priestess who also serves as a general. Male warriors, usually known as "blades," are subservient to their female commanders and are often used as expendable assets in the constant power struggles and skirmishes between houses.

6. **Spider Guard**: An elite group of warriors and assassins known as the Spider Guard serve as personal enforcers for the most powerful matron mothers and high priestesses. They are loyal only to their immediate superiors and are tasked with carrying out covert operations, assassinations, and the protection of their mistresses. Membership in the Spider Guard is highly coveted and is granted only to the most skilled and ruthless individuals.

7. **Captives Economy**: Captivity is a fundamental aspect of the economy and political structure in Lolth-worshiping cultures. Captives, taken from surface raids or rival factions within the [[Underdark]], perform the menial labor that sustains the society. The ownership and trade of captives are tightly controlled by the noble houses, and the number of captives owned by a house is a key indicator of its wealth and power. Captives are often subjected to harsh conditions and brutal treatment, reflecting the society's values of dominance and subjugation.

8. **Secret Police**: To maintain control and suppress dissent, a secret police force operates within the society, often directly under the command of the high priestesses. This force monitors the populace, rooting out traitors, spies, and anyone who might oppose the established order. They employ fear, torture, and public executions to maintain the Spider Queen's grip on power.
