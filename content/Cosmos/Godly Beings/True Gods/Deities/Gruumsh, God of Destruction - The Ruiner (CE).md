# Gruumsh, God of Destruction: The Ruiner (CE)

"Maul the weak, rip and tear until only warm blood is left. The only thing beneath you is the ground you walk on, and the only thing above you is the sky you will shred. The only thing that matters is the next kill. The space between blade and neck." - Words spoken by a follower of Gruumsh while in a battle frenzy.

## Religious Practices

2. **Warrior Ceremonies:** Ritualistic combat and displays of strength are common among the faithful of Gruumsh. Warriors may engage in duels to prove their worthiness or participate in larger battles dedicated to their god. These ceremonies serve to honor Gruumsh through acts of violence and conquest.
3. **One-Eyed Vigil:** Followers of Gruumsh may hold vigils or ceremonies where priests stab, scar or remove one of their eyes to symbolize their allegiance to the One-Eyed God. During these rituals, they meditate on their dedication to destruction and their readiness to embrace chaos in Gruumsh's name.
4. **Burning of Offerings:** In homage to Gruumsh's fiery temperament and his role as The Ruiner, followers may engage in rituals where part of their spoils of war are set ablaze. These offerings could include symbols of their enemies, representations of obstacles to their goals, or even objects of personal significance.
5. **Gor'nash** Before embarking on war or raids to intimidate their enemies, devotees of Gruumsh engage in a ritualistic chant known as Gor'nash (war-cry). This frenzied display of strength often mocks their foes, invoking Gruumsh's favor to instill fear in their enemies' hearts. With their spirits heightened and their allegiance affirmed, they charge into battle, fueled by the chaotic fury of their god.
6. **Pilgrimages to Sacred Sites:** Followers of Gruumsh may embark on pilgrimages to places associated with significant battles. These pilgrimages serve as reminders of Gruumsh's power and the importance of embracing rage and conflict in the world.
7. **Tatoos/Scars with Symbolic Imagery:** Followers of Gruumsh tattoo or scar themselves with symbols associated with their god, such as the triangular eye with bony protrusions or representations of a bleeding eye, or creating a mark for each life they take. These symbols serve as reminders of Gruumsh's presence and their commitment to his cause.
8. **Feasts of Conquest:** Ceremonial feasts are held in honor of Gruumsh following victorious battles or significant acts for the god. These feasts are characterized by extravagant displays of food and drink, with warriors recounting tales of their conquests and offering thanks to their god for his blessings in battle.

## Cultural Norms

1. **Strength and Might:** The societies that worship Gruumsh often value physical strength and martial prowess above all else. Warriors are highly esteemed, and acts of bravery and conquest are celebrated. Weakness is viewed with disdain, and individuals are expected to constantly strive to prove their worth through feats of strength and dominance.
2. **Hierarchy of Power:** Within these societies, there is typically a strong hierarchical structure based on strength and dominance. Those who demonstrate exceptional prowess in battle or leadership often rise to positions of authority and respect. Leadership is often centralized around a strong ruler or warlord who embodies the ideals of Gruumsh.
3. **Conflict and Conquest:** Warfare and conflict are integral parts of the culture, seen as opportunities to honor Gruumsh through acts of battle and conquest. Battles are fought not only for territorial expansion but also as religious rites to appease their god and demonstrate their devotion.
4. **Rituals of Sacrifice:** Sacrifice plays a significant role in the religious practices of these cultures. Whether it be blood offerings on altars dedicated to Gruumsh or gruesome sacrifices before battle, the act of giving something valuable, often life itself, is seen as a way to remind themselves to not loose focus on honing their strenght and rage.
5. **Valor in Battle and Mockery:** Cultures devoted to Gruumsh place immense value on battle, rage, and the joy of conflict. Their mockery of enemies serves not only to instill anger but also to bring them joy, viewing it as a way to showcase their own strength and prowess. Through derisive chants, displays of captured foes in humiliating ways, or acts of psychological warfare, they aim to demoralize their opponents before battle. Moreover, this mockery serves as a reminder to the weak enemies of their failure to conquer their own anger, further weakening their resolve and bolstering the faith of Gruumsh's followers in their righteous cause.
6. **Tattoos and Markings of Triumph:** Cultures devoted to Gruumsh distinguish themselves through intricate tattoos and markings that symbolize their connection to their god and their history of conquest. Adorning their bodies, attire, and architecture, these tattoos depict symbols of epic battles, representations of Gruumsh's iconic symbols, or commemorations of personal or communal victories against formidable foes. Each mark serves as a testament to their devotion to Gruumsh and their dedication to the principles of destruction and chaos. These tattoos are often applied ceremonially, with rituals and rites accompanying the process to imbue the markings with spiritual significance and divine blessing.
7. **Rites of Passage:** Coming-of-age rituals often involve deadly tests of strength and courage to prove one's worthiness as a follower of Gruumsh. These rituals may include feats of endurance, combat trials, or quests to demonstrate loyalty and devotion to their deity.
8. **Death in Fervor:** Followers of Gruumsh view death with fervor, interpreting it as a sign of strength and divine favor. It is seen either as the purging of weak blood from their ranks, strengthening the group, or as the ultimate achievement where the fallen warrior reaches their peak and ascends to join Gruumsh in battle eternal. Fallen comrades are honored not only for their individual valor but also for the contribution their death makes to the strength and unity of the group. Rituals surrounding their passing emphasize this belief, celebrating their transition to a higher plane of existence where they continue to serve their god in eternal conflict.

## Political Structures

1. **Warlordism:** Many societies devoted to Gruumsh are structured around a system of warlordism, where power is concentrated in the hands of a dominant leader or warlord who has proven their martial prowess and ability to lead in battle. The warlord holds absolute authority and commands the loyalty of their followers through strength and fear.
2. **Militaristic Hierarchies:** Political structures often mirror military hierarchies, with positions of power and authority determined by an individual's rank and combat prowess. Leaders are typically chosen based on their ability to lead troops into battle and secure victories for their people, with the strongest and most skilled warriors rising to positions of leadership.
3. **Councils of War:** In some cultures, decision-making is conducted by councils comprised of seasoned warriors and strategists who advise the ruling warlord or chieftain. These councils may convene to discuss matters of war, conquest, and governance, offering counsel and guidance based on their collective experience and expertise in battle.
4. **Tribal Confederations:** Some societies worshiping Gruumsh are organized into tribal confederations, where multiple tribes or clans band together under the leadership of a powerful warlord or chief.

5. **Feudal Systems:** In regions where Gruumsh is worshiped, feudal systems may emerge, with land and resources distributed among vassals who pledge loyalty and military service to a central ruler or warlord. The ruling elite derive their authority from their ability to protect and defend their territories, often relying on military might to maintain control.
6. **Divine Monarchies:** In cultures where Gruumsh is revered as the ultimate deity, political power may be vested in a divine monarch who is believed to rule by divine right. The monarch is seen as a direct representative of Gruumsh on earth, wielding absolute authority and serving as both a political and religious figurehead for their people.
7. **Conquest-Based Expansion:** Political structures in Gruumsh-worshiping societies are often driven by a relentless pursuit of conquest and expansion. Rulers and warlords seek to expand their territories through military campaigns, with the ultimate goal of uniting all followers of Gruumsh under a single banner of destruction and chaos.
8. **Meritocracy through Combat:** Some societies associated with Gruumsh may practice a form of meritocracy where individuals rise to positions of power and influence based on their performance in combat.
