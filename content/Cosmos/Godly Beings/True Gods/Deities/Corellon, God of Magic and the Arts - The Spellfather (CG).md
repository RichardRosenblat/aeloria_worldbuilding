## Political Structures

1. **Matriarcal Diarchy:**
    -  In societies influenced by Corellon's worship, a Matriarcal Diarchy may arise, akin to the dual rulership seen in the [[Feywild]] with Titania and the Queen of Air and Darkness. Here, power is shared between two rulers, typically titled as Queens, embodying complementary aspects of Corellon's domain. This dual leadership reflects the balance and harmony central to Corellon's teachings, ensuring nuanced governance that mirrors the complexities of existence.
2. **Council of Elders:**
    - Another political structure may involve a council of elders composed of esteemed priests, artisans, and leaders within the community. This council advises the ruling authority on matters related to governance, spirituality, and the arts, ensuring that decisions align with the values and principles of Corellon's worship.
3. **Guild-based Governance:**
    - Some societies may organize their political structure around guilds or associations dedicated to specific crafts, arts, or magical disciplines. Each guild may have its own leadership and hierarchy, with representatives coming together in a council or assembly to govern collectively. Corellon's worship serves as a unifying force among these guilds, promoting collaboration and cooperation.
4. **Feudal System with Divine Mandate:**
    - In feudal societies, political power may be distributed among noble families who hold land and exercise authority over their territories. The ruler, often a king or queen, claims legitimacy through a divine mandate bestowed by Corellon, emphasizing their duty to uphold the values of creativity, beauty, and harmony.
5. **Meritocratic Republic:**
    - In societies that prioritize individual talent and achievement, a meritocratic republic may emerge. Leadership positions are awarded based on arcane knowledge, merit, skill in arts, and contribution to the community, rather than hereditary status. Corellon's worshipers may view this system as a reflection of their deity's appreciation for creativity and ingenuity.
6. **Communal Councils:**
    - Some communities may adopt a communal governance structure where decisions are made collectively through councils or assemblies composed of representatives from various social groups. Corellon's worship fosters a sense of community and collaboration among council members, who work together to ensure the prosperity and well-being of their society.
7. **Magocracy:**
    - In societies where magic holds significant influence, a magocracy may arise, with magic-users wielding political power alongside or independently of traditional rulers.
