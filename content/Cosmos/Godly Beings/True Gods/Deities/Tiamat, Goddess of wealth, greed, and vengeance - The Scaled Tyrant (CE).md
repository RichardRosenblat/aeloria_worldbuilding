## Blessings

A follower of Tiamat can gain favor with the goddess by amassing wealth, seeking vengeance against their enemies, and embracing chaos and destruction. As they embody the principles of greed, power, and elemental fury, Tiamat may bestow the following blessings upon them:

*Any spell-like abilities granted by these blessings use the character's spellcasting ability, if the character does not have a spellcasting ability, they can use their highest ability score.*

1. **Draconic Resilience:** The follower gains resistance to a chosen elemental damage type (fire, acid, electricity, cold, or poison), the follower may change the resistance type after a long rest. They also gain advantage on saving throws against effects associated with that element. Tiamat’s blessing grants the follower the hardened scales of a dragon, offering protection against elemental attacks.

2. **Hoarding Aura:** Once per day, the follower can activate an aura that gives a bonus of +2 to their their Charisma score and provides advantage on ability checks to intimidate or coerce others. The aura lasts for 10 minutes. The aura manifests as a shimmering, multicolored light, symbolizing Tiamat's favor and influence over wealth and persuasion.

3. **Vengeful Strike:** When the follower is struck by an attack, they can use their reaction to deal damage of one of the elemental types associated with Tiamat (fire, acid, cold, electricity, or poison) to the attacker. The damage is equal to the follower's level + half of the damage taken. This blessing can be used an amount of times equal to the follower's proficiency bonus per long rest.  

4. **Scaled Form:** For 1 hour, the follower can transform their skin into dragon-like scales, granting them temporary hit points equal to twice their level and increasing their AC by 2. The scales are imbued with Tiamat's essence, providing both physical protection and a fearsome appearance. At 17th level, the follower gains immunity to the chosen elemental damage type.

5. **Greed’s Insight:** The follower gains advantage on Wisdom (Perception), Intelligence (Investigation) and Charisma (Persuasion) checks made to find, assess or sell valuable items or hidden wealth. Tiamat’s favor sharpens the follower’s senses and intellect, making them keenly aware of valuable opportunities.

6. **Dragon’s Breath:** Once per long rest, the follower can unleash a breath weapon as an action, dealing damage of an elemental type associated with Tiamat (fire, acid, cold, electricity, or poison) in a 30-foot cone or 60-foot line, depending on their choice. Emulating the destructive power of chromatic dragons, the follower can channel a devastating elemental attack. The attack deals 2d10 damage of the chosen type, with a Dexterity saving throw for half damage. The DC is 8 + the follower’s proficiency bonus + their Constitution modifier.

7. **Aura of Tyranny:** The follower exudes an aura that extends 10 feet around them. Enemies within the aura must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. They can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of their turns. Tiamat’s influence manifests as an oppressive and terrifying aura, compelling others to fear and submit to the follower’s authority.

8. **Tyrant’s Command:** The follower can use an action to compel a creature within 60 feet to obey a single command, as per the *suggestion* spell. The command must be related to gaining wealth, revenge, or an act of chaos. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw to resist. This blessing reflects Tiamat’s mastery over greed and manipulation, allowing the follower to bend others to their will through divine compulsion.
