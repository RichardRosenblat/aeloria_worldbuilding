## Religious Practices

Tiamat's followers engage in various rituals and practices to honor the goddess and seek her favor. These practices often revolve around wealth, vengeance, and the power of dragons. Here are ten common rituals performed by Tiamat's followers:

1. **Hoarding Ritual:**
   Devotees gather their wealth, particularly gold, and offer a portion to Tiamat by placing it in hidden locations or temples. This ritual symbolizes their dedication to amassing wealth and the power it brings.

2. **The Vengeful Reckoning:**
   Followers of Tiamat are encouraged to avenge any wrongs done to them. This ritual involves meditative preparation followed by an act of retribution against those who have wronged them, ensuring no affront goes unpunished.

3. **The Great Tribute:**
   Once a year, a grand ceremony is held where the wealthiest and most powerful followers present their largest treasures to the other followers. As offerings are displayed, followers compete to show off their wealth and gather more money and power to gain Tiamat's favor.

4. **Fivefold Prayer:**
   Followers perform a prayer ritual five times a day, each time focusing on one of Tiamat's five dragon heads. Each prayer involves specific chants and offerings associated with the elemental aspect of that head.

5. **Dragonborn Ascendancy:**
   A rite of passage where followers seeking higher status or power endure trials and challenges symbolizing the might of chromatic dragons. Successful participants are honored and often gain leadership roles within the cult.

6. **The Greed Fest:**
   A monthly celebration where followers indulge in feasts and display their wealth. It’s a time of boasting about recent acquisitions and plotting future gains. The most ostentatious displays are said to attract Tiamat’s attention.

7. **Ritual of the Dragon's Breath:**
   A dangerous ritual where followers expose themselves to elemental forces, such as fire or acid, to gain Tiamat’s favor. Those who survive with minimal harm are believed to be blessed with greater resilience and power.

8. **The Scaled Vigil:**
   An all-night vigil held during significant celestial events. Followers stay awake, meditate, and keep watch over their hoards, believing that Tiamat herself might visit in spirit and grant visions or insights.

9. **The Vengeance Pact:**
   A blood pact made between followers who swear to avenge each other's wrongs. This ritual solidifies bonds within the cult and ensures that any member's dishonor or harm is met with swift collective retribution.

10. **The Tyrant's Blessing:**
   A blessing ceremony for newborns within the cult. High priests bless the infants with symbols of Tiamat, marking them as future followers and promising them the goddess's favor in their pursuit of wealth and power.
