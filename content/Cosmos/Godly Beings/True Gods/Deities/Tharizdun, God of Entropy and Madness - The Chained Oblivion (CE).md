# Thariuzdun, God of Entropy and Madness - The Chained Oblivion (CE)

*"Hickory Dickory Dock*
*The mouse ran up the clock*
*The clock struck one*

*Quiver shiver and shock*
*In the shadows demon's flock*
*The stars struck two*

*Quiver shiver and shock*

*Eclipse abyss lock*
*Through the keyhole, horrors mocks*
*Time struck three*
*In the void echoes plea*

*Round the clock the old ones walk*

*At sanity's shore*

*Hickory Dickory Dock*
*In the madness we are caught*
*The end has begun*
*Under a blackened sun*
*Hickory Dickory Dock"* - Tharisdun's followers rhyme

Despite this, Tharizdun's followers maintain a intense and complex culture that reflects their devotion to the Chained Oblivion. Some common cultural norms among Tharizdun's followers include:

## Blessings

A follower of Tharidun does not gain favor with their deity as the god is sealed and cannot grant blessings. However, the followers of Tharizdun can gain blessings by tainting themselves with the energies of [[the far realm]], the void, and the madness that Tharizdun embodies.  

*Any spell-like abilities granted by these blessings use the character's spellcasting ability, if the character does not have a spellcasting ability, they can use their highest ability score.*

1. **Chtonic Gaze**: The follower's eyes can become windows to realms of madness and eldritch horror. Once per day, they can use an action to make a creature within 30 feet of them make a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened or suffer a random temporary madness effect for 1 minute. Alternatively, they can use this ability to make a creature within 30 feet of them make a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed for the duration of the eye contact (as blinking breaks the effect, refer to [[Rule - Unblinking Stare]] for more information), a creature charmed this way cannot move, attack or take any action until the effect is broken or one of the two creatures is attacked.

2. **Incomprehensible Mind**: The follower gains the feat *Telepathic*, resistance to psychic damage and no creature can read their thoughts or communicate with them telepathically unless they allow it. Tharizdun's chaotic thoughts shields their mind from external intrusion.

3. **Summon Eldritch Abomination**: Once per long rest, the follower can cast *Summon Aberration* at 5th level without expending a spell slot, material components, or concentration. After the effect, roll a d20, on a roll of 1, the creature summoned turns against the follower's party (except the follower) and attacks them for 1 minute before disappearing. If the follower has a spell slot of 6th level or higher, they can cast the spell at that level instead but for each level above 5th, the chance of the creature turning against the party increases by 1 (e.g., 6th level spell slot has a 2 in 20 chance, 7th level spell slot has a 3 in 20 chance, etc.).

4. **Sense of the Void**: The follower gains the ability to sense any creature that is not a construct within 60 feet of them along with the direction those creatures are looking at, even if they are invisible or hidden. This sense goes through walls and other obstacles, but not through magical barriers or lead. For Aberrations, the range is increased to 120 feet.

5. **Uncanny body**: The follower's body changes in subtle ways creating new limbs, eyes, or other appendages. They can now carry on their hand an amount of items equal to their proficiency bonus, their amount of attacks per turn increases by 1 at 5th level, at 11th level, and at 17th level. For an amount of times equal to their proficiency bonus per long rest, they can gain advantage on an ability check (Except persuation or deception given the unsettling nature of their appearance) or saving throw, they can choose to spend two uses of this ability to be able to concentrate on two spells at the same time for 1 minute.

6. **Unspeakable Horror's form**: The body of the follower mimics the appearance of an eldritch abomination. Once per long rest, for 1 minute, the follower can gain an amount of temporary hit points equal to their amount of hit die, an amount of additional attacks equal to their proficiency bonus, and their movement speed is doubled. During the transformation the follower also gains one of the following attributes to their choice (It is possible to pick more than one but after the transformation ends, the follower takes 1d12 psychic damage for each attribute they chose during the transformation other than the first) and recieves one level of exhaustion. The damage caused cannot be reduced or avoided in any way as it damages the follower's very being. 
    - A type of damage resistance of their choice 
    - A type of sense of their choice (e.g., blindsight, tremorsense, etc.)
    - A type of movement of their choice (e.g., flying, swimming, etc.)
    - A new attack option using a new limb or appendage that deals 1d10 damage of a type of their choice
    - A new attack option by launching a projectile that deals 1d10 damage of a type of their choice and has a range of 60 feet
    - Either: The skill to move through any opening at least 1 inch wide without squeezing or Any creature that touches the follower or hits it with a melee attack takes 1d10 acid damage 
  
7. **Dimensional Warp**: The follower chooses a point they can see, or is within 60 feet of them, and can teleport to that point as a bonus action. After using this ability, a small distortion in reality remains in the point they teleported from and the point they teleported to until the end of their next turn. Any creature can use this distortion to teleport to the other point as a bonus action, but any creature other than the follower that uses this distortion takes 1d4 psychic damage. The follower can use this ability a number of times equal to their proficiency bonus per long rest.

8. **Chains of the Mad God**: The follower can cast either *Hold Person*, *Hold Monster*, *Tasha's Hideous Laughter*, *Crown of Madness*, or *Banishment* without expending a spell slot or material components, once per long rest. 
  - When *Hold Person* or *Hold Monster* is cast, chains bind the adversary, causing them to laugh, cry uncontrollably, or babble incoherently if they can speak.
  - Alternatively, the chains can wrap around the target’s head, invoking the effects of *Tasha's Hideous Laughter* or *Crown of Madness* for the spell’s duration.
  - If the target's origin plane differs from the current one, the chains can hook into the target’s body, causing the effect of the *Banishment* spell for the spell’s duration.

## Curses

Through interaction with Tharizdun, and the forces of madness and chaos, the follower can invoke the wrath of the different aspects of the eldritch realm to bestow curses upon their enemies. These are some examples of the curses that the follower can invoke upon their enemies:

The follower must cast *Bestow Curse* to invoke their available curses:

1. **Curse of Chaotic Visions**: The target is plagued by disturbing, chaotic visions that distract and confuse them. They have disadvantage on all attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws while they are under this curse.

2. **Curse of Entropic Decay**: The target's body begins to decay and weaken. They suffer disadvantage on all Strength and Constitution checks and saving throws, and their maximum hit points are reduced by 1d10 each hour until the curse is lifted. If their maximum hit points reach 0, the target falls dead and their body becomes an distubing manifestation of Tharidun's madnesss, e.g., a bunch of chain covered by skin, the body becomes a group of spiders that skitter away

3. **Curse of Maddening Whispers**: The target hears incessant, maddening whispers that distract and disturb them. They must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw at the start of each of their turns or be unable to take actions or reactions until the start of their next turn.

4. **Curse of the Void**: The target's connection to the material world is weakened. They have disadvantage on all Dexterity, Strenght and Constituiton checks and saving throws, and any teleportation or dimensional travel they attempt causes them to roll a d4. On a 4 the target can travel normally, on a 3 they are transported to a random location, on a 2 they are not transported 

5. **Curse of Unraveling**: The target's magical defenses are compromised. They have disadvantage on saving throws against any spells and magical effects, and they become incapable of concentrating on spells or maintaining concentration on spells they cast.

6. **Curse of Temporal Instability**: The target's perception of time becomes erratic. At the start of each of their turns, roll a d6. On a roll of 1-2, the target is affected by the *Slow* spell until the start of their next turn. On a roll of 3-4, the target's limbs become stuck in time, causing them to be unable to move or take actions until the start of their next turn but also making them incapable of falling prone or being moved by any means. On a roll of 5-6, the target is paralyzed until the start of their next turn but also gains resistance to all damage until the start of their next turn and are incapable of being moved by any means.

7. **Curse of Insatiable Hunger**: The target is overwhelmed by a gnawing, insatiable hunger. They have disadvantage on all attack rolls and ability checks unless they spend their action each turn to consume food or attempt to eat anything within reach.

8. **Curse of Shattered Reality**: The target's sense of reality begins to fracture. They must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw at the start of each of their turns or be affected by the *Confusion* spell until the start of their next turn.
