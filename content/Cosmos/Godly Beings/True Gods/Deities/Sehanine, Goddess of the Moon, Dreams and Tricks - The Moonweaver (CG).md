And once you are back, you can sing us the beauty you've seen. So there's no need to think of time, nor what is left of it, just follow the journey you need to take... Huh... I'm sorry for crying... I just... I just love you so much, so please smile on your journey, for I will be waiting for you." - The old priestess of Sehanine, to an adventurer before they left.
