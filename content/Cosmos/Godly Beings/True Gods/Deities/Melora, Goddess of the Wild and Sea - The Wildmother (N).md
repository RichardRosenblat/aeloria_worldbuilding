# Melora, Goddess of the Wild and Sea - The Wildmother (N)

"Melora, wild and free,
In forests deep and boundless sea,
Guide us with your timeless grace,
Through nature's realm, find our place.

In every tree, in every wave,
Your spirit strong, our hearts brave,
Protect us in the wild's embrace,
In harmony, we find our space.

The quiet shade, across old bark,
In the Ancient Glade, it is always dark,
Yet in the shadows, your light does gleam,
Guiding us through the stream." - Poem written in prayer to the Wildmother
