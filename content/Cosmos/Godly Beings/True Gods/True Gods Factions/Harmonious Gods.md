# The Harmonious Gods: Custodians of Creation

## Celestial Harmony
In the grand tapestry of [[Aeloria]]'s celestial realms, a faction known as the Harmonious Deities emerged in response to the growing discord among the [[True Gods]]. Unlike their dissatisfied counterparts, the Harmonious Gods stood as staunch proponents of the intrinsic beauty woven into the fabric of creation.

## Embracing Imperfections
For the Harmonious Gods, imperfections were not flaws to be eradicated but rather integral elements of the grand tapestry of existence. They believed in the potential for mortals to transcend adversity and emerge stronger, viewing challenges as deliberate components of the divine plan.

## Guardians of Transformation
Guided by a deep understanding of the cosmic cycle, the Harmonious Gods sought to nurture and guide the creatures they had brought into being. Their commitment to fostering growth and enlightenment among mortals was unwavering, seeing struggles not as obstacles but as opportunities for profound transformation.

## The Unlikely Alliance
Amidst celestial discord, an unlikely alliance formed between the Harmonious Gods and the [[Defiant Gods]]. Despite their profound differences, the impending threat of chaotic primordial forces compelled these factions to set aside grievances, marking a delicate pact in the face of impending chaos.

## Dragons as Agents of Harmony
In the collaboration between the Harmonious Gods and the [[Defiant Gods]], [[Bahamut, God  of Justice and Nobility - The Platinum Dragon (LG)|Bahamut]] and Tiamat, two formidable [[True Gods]], collaborated to give birth to dragons. Chromatic Dragons, created by Tiamat, were tasked with resisting elemental forces, while Metallic Dragons, crafted by [[Bahamut, God  of Justice and Nobility - The Platinum Dragon (LG)|Bahamut]], became wise and intelligent custodians of mortal realms.

## Pivotal Role of Dragons
These dragons played a crucial role in sealing potent primordial elements, creating [[elemental planes]] and casting them into the [[Elemental Chaos]]. The leakage of elemental energies, redirected by the [[True Gods]], fueled the magic of [[Corellon, God of Magic and the Arts - The Spellfather (CG)|Corellon]], becoming a catalyst for the control of elemental energies.

## Golden Age of Knowledge
In the era of divine enlightenment, the Harmonious Gods generously shared their timeless wisdom with mortals, leading to a golden age of knowledge. Magic became a disciplined pursuit, and the secrets of the world unfolded under the nurturing guidance of benevolent deities.

## Striving for Balance
The Harmonious Gods stood as guardians of a vision where the interplay of opposing forces became a source of strength and resilience for both the divine and mortal realms. Their commitment to balance and preservation was reflected in the crafting of [[Harmonious Vestiges]]—artifacts intended to bring stability to the tumultuous world.

## Legacy of Divine Conflict
In the aftermath of [[The Great War (GW)|The Great War]], the legacy of the Harmonious Gods endured as symbols of balance and harmony. The reformed pantheon, anchored by [[Aena, goddess of kindness, creation and order - The Architect (LG)|Aena]] and [[Kryela, goddess of malice, destruction and chaos - The Undoing (CE)|Kryela]]'s divine intervention and [[The Divine Accord]], reflected a new era where [[True Gods]] and mortals coexisted, healing the scars of divine conflict.
