# True Gods in [[Aeloria]]

## Introduction
In the mystical world of [[Aeloria]], True gods, also known as Deities or Powers, play a crucial role in shaping the fabric of reality. Rooted in the creation myth of the world, the gods' existence is intertwined with the cosmic forces and the delicate balance between order and chaos.

## The True Gods
The True Gods in [[Aeloria]] are extraordinarily powerful beings who gain strength as they amass followers. However, their might is not absolute, as they all bow before the [[Over-Deities]], [[Aena, goddess of kindness, creation and order - The Architect (LG)|Aena]] and [[Kryela, goddess of malice, destruction and chaos - The Undoing (CE)|Kryela]]. These [[Over-Deities|twin goddesses]], the first beings to exist, hold unparalleled authority and have established [[The Divine Accord]]—a set of laws that govern the conduct of the True Gods.

## True Gods vs. Godly beings
While True Gods derive their power from the first [[Divine Spark|Divine Sparks]] created by [[Aena, goddess of kindness, creation and order - The Architect (LG)|Aena]] and [[Kryela, goddess of malice, destruction and chaos - The Undoing (CE)|Kryela]], there are other immensely powerful creatures known as godly beings. These beings, although godly in power, lack the direct connection to the [[Over-Deities|The Dyad]], having a [[divine spark]] kindled from a True God or another divine being. The true distinction lies in the origin of their divine essence—True Gods are creations of [[Aena, goddess of kindness, creation and order - The Architect (LG)|Aena]] and [[Kryela, goddess of malice, destruction and chaos - The Undoing (CE)|Kryela]], possessing limitless potential based on followers.

## Immaterial Essence

In their truest form, True Gods exist without physical bodies. They are immaterial patterns of desires and behaviors that shape energies within reality. These patterns, in turn, are fueled by the [[divine spark]] that defines the essence of the True Gods.

This inherent lack of physical form imposes a limitation on True Gods, compelling them to rely on Avatars as conduits for interaction with the mortal realm.

## Avatars

### Definition

Avatars serve as the physical manifestations of the divine essence and power of True Deities. These manifestations embody the will of the True Gods and take on mortal forms. Despite their mortal nature, the death of an Avatar does not equate to the demise of the True God, unless their [[divine spark]] is stolen or extinguished.

### Existence in Other Planes

Avatars are bound by the restrictions of [[the Divine Accord]], preventing their existence in the [[material plane]]. However, they can manifest in other planes, often found in [[Metapsychic Planes]] where the gods are close to the souls of those who worshipped them.

### Mortality of Avatars

Though mortal, the death of an Avatar does not bring about the end of the True God. Instead, it serves as a temporary setback, with the True God remaining untouched unless a dire fate befalls their [[divine spark]].

### Connection with Worshipers

Avatars play a crucial role in the connection between True Gods and their followers. When worshippers are granted visions of their gods, it is often the Avatars that appear in their minds, representing different facets of the deity. True Gods commonly have multiple avatars, each crafted to embody diverse aspects of the god, adapting to the varied perceptions found in different cultures.

### [[The Divine Accord]]
[[The Divine Accord]] imposes limitations on the True Gods, emphasizing principles such as:

This accord emerged as a response to the chaotic conflicts among gods and the need for a structured approach to their interaction with the mortal realm.

## Evolution of Gods
Before [[The Divine Accord]], gods were not confined to specific domains or aspects of reality. However, after its creation, the gods became tied to particular facets of existence. This transformation imposed order upon their chaotic influence, shaping the world in accordance with the principles set by [[Aena, goddess of kindness, creation and order - The Architect (LG)|Aena]] and [[Kryela, goddess of malice, destruction and chaos - The Undoing (CE)|Kryela]].

## Lost Paths to Godhood
In the past, godly beings were capable of becoming True gods, by killing gods and absorbing their Original [[Divine Spark]] in their identity. And later on, there were ways for mortal entities to ascend to true godhood without [[Aena, goddess of kindness, creation and order - The Architect (LG)|Aena]] and [[Kryela, goddess of malice, destruction and chaos - The Undoing (CE)|Kryela]]'s involvement, by creating a Original [[Divine Spark]] from existing ones. Unfortunately, this knowledge has been erased by [[Over-Deities|the twin goddesses]] themselves, leaving the pursuit of such paths shrouded in mystery.
