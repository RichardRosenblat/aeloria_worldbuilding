# Aspects

## Introduction

In the expansive cosmos of [[Aeloria]], where the divine and mortal realms intertwine, Godly Beings known as Aspects manifest as extensions, unions, or creations of the [[True Gods]]. 

## Nature of Aspects

Aspects are fleeting entities, embodying overwhelming power as extensions of the [[True Gods]]. Unlike mere puppets following divine will, they possess individuality, free will, and their own objectives. Their existence is marked by an ephemeral [[divine spark]], a distinct feature that sets them apart from the Original [[divine spark]] carried by [[True Gods]].

## [[Divine Spark]]: Ephemeral vs. Original

While [[True Gods]] carry the enduring Original [[divine spark]], Aspects bear ephemeral [[Divine Spark|divine sparks]]. These sparks grant them limited existence, created and summoned for specific purposes. Once their mission is fulfilled or conditions met, Aspects dissipate, returning divine power to their creators.

## Types of Aspects

### Individual Aspects

Aspects crafted by a single god serve specific roles:
- **Representation of Domain:** Reflecting a facet of the god's dominion and thus a fraction of their power, an example of such being could be represented as an aspect of [[Erathis, Goddess of Civilization and Invention - The Lawbearer (LN)|Erathis]] embodying the laws supporting the foundation of a great planar city. Usually, these Aspects gain free will and individuality, acting independently from their creators but mostly in alignment with their goals.
- **Agent of the [[True Gods|True God]]:** Mirroring the [[True Gods|True God]]'s appearance but wielding only a fraction of their power. For instance, aspects of [[Tiamat, Goddess of wealth, greed, and vengeance - The Scaled Tyrant (CE)|Tiamat]] spread across planes, amassing wealth for the goddess of greed. Usually, these Aspects are bound to the will of their creators, acting as extensions of their divine will.

### Joined Aspects

Crafted by multiple gods, these aspects symbolize common ground and overlaps between domains:
- **Harmony of Domains:** Representing the collaboration of gods like [[Corellon, God of Magic, Spring, Creativity and the Arts - The Spellfather (CG)|Corellon]] and [[Melora, Goddess of the Wild and Sea - The Wildmother (N)|Melora]], a joined aspect might embody magical elemental disasters, foretelling impending magical destruction.

## [[The Divine Accord|Divine Accord]] and Existence in the [[Material Plane|Prime Material]] Plane

Some Aspects are permitted to manifest in the [[Material Plane|Prime Material]] Plane, acting as intermediaries between the divine and mortal realms, but as all divine beings, they are bound by the [[The Divine Accord|Divine Accord]]. 

The Aspects that do not have individuality are bound to the will of their creators, acting as extensions of their divine will. And thus they are not allowed to manifest in the [[Material Plane|prime material]] plane.

As beings of free will, Aspects with individuality can navigate the [[Material Plane|prime material]] plane under [[the Divine Accord]]. 

Although some Aspects are allowed to manifest in the [[Material Plane|prime material]] plane, some hindrances may be imposed upon them. For example, Individual Aspects experience a substantial power reduction when manifesting in the [[Material Plane|prime material]] plane, whereas Joined Aspects thrive without setbacks, showcasing the intricate balance between divine entities and the mortal realm.
