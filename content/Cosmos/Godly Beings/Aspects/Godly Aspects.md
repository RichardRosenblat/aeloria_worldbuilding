# Aspects

## Introduction

In the expansive cosmos of [[Aeloria]], where the divine and mortal realms intertwine, Godly Beings known as Aspects manifest as extensions, unions, or creations of the [[True Gods]]. 

## Nature of Aspects

Aspects are fleeting entities, embodying overwhelming power as extensions of the [[True Gods]]. Unlike mere puppets following divine will, they possess individuality, free will, and their own objectives. Their existence is marked by an ephemeral [[divine spark]], a distinct feature that sets them apart from the Original [[divine spark]] carried by [[True Gods]].

## [[Divine Spark]]: Ephemeral vs. Original

While [[True Gods]] carry the enduring Original [[divine spark]], Aspects bear ephemeral [[Divine Spark|divine sparks]]. These sparks grant them limited existence, created and summoned for specific purposes. Once their mission is fulfilled or conditions met, Aspects dissipate, returning divine power to their creators.

## Types of Aspects

### Individual Aspects

Aspects crafted by a single god serve specific roles:
- **Representation of Domain:** Reflecting a facet of the god's dominion and thus a fraction of their power, an example of such being could be represented as an aspect of Erathis embodying the laws supporting the foundation of a great planar city.
- **Agent of the [[True Gods|True God]]:** Mirroring the [[True Gods|True God]]'s appearance but wielding only a fraction of their power. For instance, aspects of Tiamat spread across planes, amassing wealth for the goddess of greed.

### Joined Aspects

Crafted by multiple gods, these aspects symbolize common ground and overlaps between domains:
- **Harmony of Domains:** Representing the collaboration of gods like [[Corellon, God of Magic and the Arts - The Spellfather (CG)|Corellon]] and Melora, a joined aspect might embody magical elemental disasters, foretelling impending magical destruction.

## [[The Divine Accord|Divine Accord]] and Existence in the [[Material Plane|Prime Material]] Plane

As beings of free will, Aspects can navigate the [[Material Plane|prime material]] plane under [[the Divine Accord]]. Individual Aspects experience a substantial power reduction, whereas Joined Aspects thrive without setbacks, showcasing the intricate balance between divine entities and the mortal realm.
