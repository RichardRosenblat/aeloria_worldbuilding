# Titans: Godly Beings of Immense Power

## Origin and Creation
Titans are extraordinary beings brought into existence by the unconscious overflow of power from [[True Gods]]. These entities are characterized by their immense strength, commanding fear among mortals.

## Essence of Titans
Titans are essentially composed of the raw power that coalesces during the creation process. They embody the very essence of the [[True Gods]] who inadvertently brought them into being.

## Guardians and Hunted
Some titans are nurtured and protected by the gods responsible for their unintentional creation, with empyreans being an example of such. Conversely, others are actively hunted down by their creators. Despite being incapable of direct destruction by [[True Gods]], titans can be slain by followers of the god, other deities, or other powerful entities.

## Diverse Nature
The nature of titans mirrors the multifaceted aspects of the [[True Gods]]. While some may share similarities, each titan possesses unique characteristics. The only consistent trait among them is their overwhelming power.

## Subclassifications
Titans, despite their individuality, can exhibit similarities, leading to the creation of subclassifications. Examples include empyreans, tarrasques, Astral Dreadnoughts, and the formidable Tromokrates.

## Material Existence
Titans, endowed with individuality and will, can manifest in the [[material plane]]. However, many [[True Gods]] seek to prevent this, either by banishing their titans to other planes or confining them within the [[True Gods|true god]]'s residence plane.

## [[Divine Spark]]
Titans carry a [[divine spark]] akin to [[True Gods]], but with a crucial difference. While [[True Gods]] possess Original [[Divine Spark|Divine sparks]], titans bear unstable [[Divine Spark|divine sparks]]. Their accidental creation renders their power immense and unpredictable, leading to occasional bursts of divine energy at the core of the titan.
