| Halcyon/Frostfeather Song | A melodic tale that reveres a magical bird species known as Halcyon.

# Understanding Magic for Each Class

In the realm of magical prowess, various classes possess distinct approaches to harnessing arcane forces. While some beings, such as dragons and beholders, inherently wield the weave, most humanoids lack this natural aptitude. Instead, they must acquire it through diverse means: inherent birthright, self-modification, divine bestowment, or latent potential, which can be unlocked through intense study, meditation, potent emotions, or enchanted artifacts.

It's imperative to acknowledge the uniqueness of each character. Their magical capabilities may diverge from the standard conventions outlined here. This serves as a foundational framework, allowing flexibility for players whose characters operate differently. Collaboratively, you and your players can tailor their magical essence to suit their individuality, crafting bespoke systems that enrich their gameplay experiences while ensuring mutual enjoyment.

## Artificer: Mastery Through Ingenuity

Artificers diverge from conventional magical practitioners, employing a unique approach to channeling arcane energies. Rather than directly drawing from the weave or manipulating it themselves, they rely on meticulous study to manipulate their tools. Through precise movements and incantations, they siphon energy from the weave into their tools, subsequently infusing it into their creations.

During spell preparation and casting, artificers leverage their expertise in mechanics and alchemy. They craft specialized items capable of interfacing with the weave, either replicating spell effects or serving as conduits for it's magic to cast them. This ingenuity allows artificers to manifest spells through their inventions, showcasing their mastery of both science and magic.

## Bard: Harmonizing with the Weave

Bards traverse the realms of magic and artistry, weaving spells through their profound understanding of creativity. Through their expertise in music theory, acting, color theory, poetry, or any other artistic disciplines, they acquire the ability to siphon energy from the weave. This knowledge, coupled with relentless practice, induces profound changes in their brains, enabling them to subconsciously tap into the weave while engaged in artistic contemplation.

During moments of rest and reflection, bards effortlessly draw upon this stored energy. Whether silently recalling melodies, pondering past performances, or delving into the intricacies of their craft's theory, they unconsciously replenish their magical reserves. Subsequently, they manifest spells by expressing them through their art, akin to how they convey emotions through their performances. This symbiotic relationship between magic and artistry enables bards to seamlessly integrate spells into their creative endeavors, crafting enchanting experiences that captivate both hearts and minds.

## Cleric: Divine Channeling of Weave Energy

Clerics, entrusted with divine power by the gods, operate on a distinct paradigm from conventional spellcasters. Unlike those who directly tap into the weave, clerics receive their magic through divine intervention. During their meditative rituals, the gods imbue their bodies with energy drawn from the weave, manifesting as spell slots within them.

In a sacred exchange, the gods not only infuse clerics with energy but also bestow upon them the knowledge required to wield it. Through divine communion, clerics are granted insights into spellcasting, enabling them to effectively utilize the energy bestowed upon them. This divine guidance empowers clerics to channel the weave's energy with purpose and efficacy, fulfilling their sacred duties as intermediaries between the mortal realm and the divine.

## Druid: Harmonizing with Nature's Weave

Druids embark on a spiritual journey, forging a profound connection with the weave through relentless meditation and attunement to the natural world. Guided by ancient rituals and meditative practices, they cultivate a heightened sensitivity to the weave's energies and the elemental forces inherent in matter. These endeavors amplify their innate abilities, enabling them to commune with the weave and channel its energy.

Through disciplined meditation and sharpening of their senses, druids learn to perceive the subtle vibrations of the weave and the elemental energies coursing through the natural realm. This heightened awareness allows them to absorb energy from the weave during periods of rest and meditation, storing it within their bodies as spell slots. With this reservoir of energy at their disposal, druids attune themselves to the flow of the weave and the elemental currents, intuitively understanding how to cast spells. 

Drawing upon their intimate connection with nature, druids navigate the weave's currents with finesse. They sense its ebb and flow, discerning the intricate patterns and rhythms that govern its essence. Utilizing this profound insight, druids manipulate the weave with movements, spoken incantations, and materials, seamlessly weaving spells into the fabric of reality.

## Monk: Channeling Elemental Ki

Monks embark on a path of disciplined study and rigorous training, honing their minds and bodies to harness the elemental energy inherent within them—the essence known as Ki. Through their dedicated practice, monks cultivate a profound understanding of this inner energy, learning to manipulate it with precision.

Their studies not only sharpen their physical prowess but also attune their minds to the weave's subtle currents. With intense concentration, monks can quickly move their ki across their body to pierce the threads of the weave that flow through their bodies, piercing them to amplify their own Ki. By gathering and channeling this augmented energy, monks replicate spell effects or cast spells themselves.

Utilizing their mastery over Ki, monks seamlessly integrate magical effects into their martial techniques. Through fluid movements and precise control, they infuse their strikes with elemental energy, unleashing devastating attacks or invoking mystical phenomena. This harmonious union of mind, body, and Ki allows monks to transcend the physical limitations of the body and tap into the weave's boundless potential.

## Paladin: Divine Conduit of Weave Energy

Paladins, champions of divine justice, draw upon the power of the gods to fuel their cause. Like clerics, they receive their magical abilities through divine grace rather than direct manipulation of the weave. During their devout meditations, the gods imbue their bodies with the raw energy of the weave, shaping it into spell slots within them.

In this sacred communion, the gods not only infuse paladins with energy but also impart the knowledge required to wield it effectively. Through divine revelation, paladins are granted insights into spellcasting, empowering them to utilize the energy bestowed upon them with purpose and clarity. This divine guidance enables paladins to channel the weave's energy in service of their god's ideals, manifesting spells to smite enemies.

## Ranger: Communion with Nature's Weave

Rangers, attuned to the rhythms of the natural world, forge a bond with the weave through their intimate connection with the creatures and landscapes they protect and live with. Unlike druids, who commune with nature through traditional rituals and meditations, rangers perceive the weave's essence by immersing themselves in the diverse ecosystems they inhabit.

Through their close companionship with the creatures of the wild and their keen observation of nature's intricacies, rangers develop a profound understanding of the weave and the elemental energies that permeate the natural realm. Their senses become finely attuned to the subtle nuances of the weave's currents, allowing them to subconsciously siphon energy while at rest, focusing on the symphony of reality around them. 

To cast spells, rangers draw upon this stored energy, honing their focus on the elemental forces coursing through the natural world. By intuitively sensing the ebb and flow of the weave and the elemental energy within their surroundings, they weave spells into existence. Through this instinctual connection with nature's weave, rangers wield spells with precision, utilizing their knowledge of the natural world to guide their movements, speech, and material components.

## Sorcerer: Innate Weave Manipulation

Sorcerers possess an innate connection to the weave, bestowed upon them from birth. Unlike other spellcasters who must learn to tap into the weave, sorcerers intuitively sense its presence and manipulate it effortlessly. For them, wielding magic is as natural as any other bodily movement.

Even during moments of rest, sorcerers unconsciously draw energy from the weave, storing it within their bodies as a wellspring of power. When the need arises to cast a spell, they instinctively use this stored energy, intuitively grasping the necessary movements, words, or materials required. With a mere thought, they mold the energies of the weave into spells, seamlessly manifesting their magical abilities.

This innate affinity for the weave grants sorcerers a unique and fluid approach to spellcasting, allowing them to adapt and innovate with ease. Freed from the constraints of traditional spellcasting techniques, sorcerers wield their magic with unparalleled spontaneity and creativity, harnessing the raw essence of the weave to shape reality according to their will.

## Warlock: Varied Pact Magic

The magic wielded by warlocks is as diverse as the patrons they serve and the pacts they forge. Depending on the nature of their patron and the terms of their pact, warlocks access the weave in myriad ways, each imbuing their magic with unique characteristics.

Some patrons bestow upon their warlocks physical alterations, enabling them to tap into the weave subconsciously or consciously. Through these alterations, warlocks become conduits for the weave's energy, allowing them to wield magic with heightened proficiency.

Others patrons infuse their warlocks' bodies with the raw energy they take of the weave, whispering them the knowledge to cast spells. This direct infusion of energy empowers warlocks with knowledge and power to manipulate the energy within with ease, manifesting their magical abilities through sheer force of will.

Alternatively, some patrons may use the ones contracted to them as a proxy for their own spells, casting spells through the warlock as a conduit. In these cases, warlocks need only request the desired spell, and if the patron deems it appropriate and their body can withstand the influx of energy, the spell is cast.

In many instances, a blend of these methods may be employed, resulting in a hybrid approach to pact magic. Warlocks, therefore, wield a versatile and adaptable form of magic, shaped by the intricacies of their individual pacts and the whims of their otherworldly patrons.

## Wizard: Scholarly Mastery of the Weave

Wizards, scholars of the arcane, unlock the secrets of the weave through rigorous study and contemplation. Delving into its patterns, logic, and mathematical underpinnings, they unravel the mysteries of magic and reshape the inner workings of their minds in the process. Through their profound understanding of the weave, wizards learn to consciously and subconsciously siphon energy from its vast tapestry while at rest.

The intensive study undertaken by wizards fundamentally alters the structure of their brains, imprinting upon them the intricate thought patterns necessary to harness the weave's energy. This transformation grants them access to spell slots, repositories of magical energy that they can tap into to cast spells.

When it comes time to cast a spell, wizards draw upon this stored energy, channeling it through precise movements, incantations, and material components. Through their meticulous study of spells, they have uncovered the specific gestures, words, and materials required to manifest each magical effect.

With each spell cast, wizards further refine their understanding of the weave, deepening their connection to its vast reservoirs of power. Their mastery of magic is a testament to their scholarly dedication and unwavering pursuit of arcane knowledge.

## Non-Magical Classes and Weave Interaction

In the diverse tapestry of adventurers, non-magical classes possess the ability to tap into the weave through various means, each influenced by their individual backgrounds and class abilities. Whether acquired through study, meditation, unconscious intuition, divine bestowment, or the utilization of potent magic items, the methods by which non-magical classes access the weave can vary significantly.

Some non-magical classes possess innate abilities to sap and utilize energy from the weave unconsciously, enabling them to perform extraordinary feats beyond the realm of traditional spellcasting. For instance, barbarians who follow the Path of The Zealot may draw upon the weave's energy to fuel their fervent attacks and unleash devastating displays of strength and resilience.

Each class brings its own unique approach to interacting with the weave, reflecting the diversity of skills and backgrounds among adventurers. Whether through rigorous training, divine intervention, or instinctual intuition, non-magical classes demonstrate that the weave's influence extends far beyond the realm of traditional spellcasting.


# Energies

## Metadynamic Energies: Foundations of Existence in [[Aeloria]]

### Overview:
In the intricate tapestry of [[Aeloria]]'s reality, the very essence of existence is shaped by metadynamic energies. These foundational energies serve as the building blocks for a hierarchy of forces, including meta-elemental energies, elemental energies, and beyond.

### Two Fundamental Types: existential and Non-existential Energies
Metadynamic energies can be classified into two primary types: Existential and Non-existential energies. These energies define the duality of reality and non-reality, shaping the very fabric of existence and non-existence.

#### Existential metadynamic energy:
Existential metadynamic energy, or Existence metadynamic energy serves as the blueprint for reality, portraying it as a blank slate waiting to be filled. It intricately describes the meta-elemental energies that manifest within this reality. Both reality and meta-elemental energies are embodiments of existence energy. The [[over-deities]] [[Aena, goddess of kindness, creation and order - The Architect (LG)|Aena]] and [[Kryela, goddess of malice, destruction and chaos - The Undoing (CE)\|Kryela]] are, together, the originators of this metadynamic energy, utilizing it to irradiate [[Aeloria]]'s reality. Entities directly created by these [[over-deities]], including [[true gods]] and [[Divine Spark|Divine sparks]], embody extreme levels of existence energy, some even capable of adding more into the reality it describes, creating realms and domains around their avatars or bodies. Those being able to exhibit limited control over specific domains/areas within [[Aeloria]]'s reality.

#### Non-existential metadynamic energy:
In contrast, Non-existential metadynamic energy (also called Non-existence metadynamic energy or anti-existence metadynamic energy ) carries an eldritch nature, emanating from the [[The Far Realm|far realms]] and it's inhabitants, those being cosmic aberrations and elder evils. This metadynamic energy is incomprehensible and behaves in ways inherently incompatible with [[Aeloria|Aelorian]] materials and minds. Entities native to the [[The Far Realm|far realms]], such as elder evils and cosmic aberrations, exude non-existence energy. The interaction of this energy with [[Aeloria|Aelorian]] reality varies—some embodiments prove toxic and harmful, while others coexist or remain indifferent. Different levels of non-existence energy permeate both reality and non-reality, presenting varying degrees of influence across the expansive cosmos of [[Aeloria]].

### Control and Interaction:
Those capable of generating or creating metadynamic energies, whether existence or non-existence, hold limited levels of control over specific domains within the irradiated areas. The delicate dance between these fundamental forces shapes the very foundations of the mystical realm, giving rise to the diverse energies, entities, and phenomena that populate its reality and non-reality alike.

## Meta-Elemental Energies in [[Aeloria]]

### Overview:
In [[Aeloria]], the fabric of reality is intricately woven with meta-elemental energies. These forces govern the very essence of existence, influencing everything from matter and energy to entropy, morality, and consciousness.

### Fundamental Nature:
Meta-elemental energies are the foundational fields that allow the existence of all things, defining their attributes and behaviors. They encompass aspects such as time, space, matter, energy, entropy, consciousness, and morality. Even entities that seem to neither add nor subtract actually engage in both actions through an intricate overlap.

### Hierarchy of Existence:
The elemental forces, representing various aspects of the world, are constructed from the interplay of two primary meta-elemental forces. These forces serve as the building blocks, and all other entities in [[Aeloria]] are, in turn, constructed from these elemental forces. Defining a comprehensive set of rules for these meta-elemental energies proves challenging due to the similarities in behavior among certain embodiments. Nomenclature becomes a matter of perspective.

#### Example: Matter and Anti-Matter:
A striking example of this complex interplay is the relationship between matter (representing addition meta-elemental energy) and anti-matter (representing subtraction meta-elemental energy). These two can be interchangeably referred to, as they exhibit identical behaviors with each other and within themselves. The distinction between the two depends solely on the observer's point of reference.

#### Positive Energy - Addition Meta-elemental energy:
Representative of the [[Over-Deities|over-deity]] [[Aena, goddess of kindness, creation and order - The Architect (LG)|Aena, goddess of kindness, creation and order - The Architect ]], positive energy is a meta-elemental force. It serves as the base for entities and phenomena that involve addition, such as the creation of matter, energy, time, and their movements. While not confined to the [[plane of energy]] or life, positive energy is most abundant there, especially at its peak in the [[plane of energy]].

#### Negative Energy - Subtraction Meta-elemental energy:
Representative of the [[Over-Deities|over-deity]] [[Kryela, goddess of malice, destruction and chaos - The Undoing (CE)|Kryela, goddess of malice, destruction and chaos - The Undoing ]], negative energy is another meta-elemental force. It forms the foundation for entities and phenomena associated with subtraction, including the removal of matter, energy, timelessness, and their stagnation. Despite being present in planes like void, darkness, or necromancy, negative energy is most prominent in the [[plane of void]], particularly at its highest levels.

## Elemental Forces, Divine Mathematical Functions
In the cosmology of [[Aeloria]], elemental forces are structured by meta-elemental energies and behave akin to mathematical functions, conceptualized by the [[over-deities]] during the founding of reality. These functions operate by transforming input meta-elemental energy into distinct output effects, their formats and effects in the surrounding reality shaped by the intentions and power of those interacting with them.

### Types of Elemental Forces
[[Aeloria]]'s elemental forces categorize into three main types: mostly positive, neutral, and mostly negative. Each type exhibits unique characteristics and response patterns based on the nature of their input meta-elemental energy.

#### Mostly Positive Elemental Forces
Represented by forces like the Life Elemental Force, mostly positive forces generate predominantly positive output effects when infused with positive meta-elemental energy. Conversely, they produce negative meta-elemental energy when exposed to negative meta-elemental energy.

#### Neutral Elemental Forces
Neutral forces, such as the Invocation Elemental Force, possess a balanced disposition, capable of generating either positive or negative output effects depending on the intent behind their interaction rather than the type of meta-elemental energy fed into their inputs.

#### Mostly Negative Elemental Forces
Embodied by entities like the Necromancy Elemental Force, mostly negative forces yield primarily negative output effects when supplied with positive meta-elemental energy. Conversely, they manifest positive meta-elemental energy when infused with negative meta-elemental energy.

### [[Over-Deities]]' Influence
[[Aena, goddess of kindness, creation and order - The Architect (LG)|Aena]] and [[Kryela, goddess of malice, destruction and chaos - The Undoing (CE)|Kryela]], the [[over-deities]] of [[Aeloria]], continually generate meta-dynamic energy that sustains reality. Additionally, they individually produce meta-elemental energies, essential for fueling and maintaining elemental forces throughout existence, the elemental forces each describe reality and the interaction between parts of it, and serves to feed the Weave.

### The Weave: Conduit of Elemental Energy
The Weave serves as a vast web that channels the elemental force of energy across all realms. As the elemental force of energy is mostly positive, it creates the flow of positive meta-elemental energy throughout [[Aeloria]]. As a result, practitioners of magic typically access standard elemental outputs of the elements, necessitating the blending of multiple elemental energies to achieve effects associated with reversed outputs.

### Blessed Individuals and Elemental Mastery
Certain individuals possess the rare gift of harnessing and generating both positive and negative energies. These gifted beings can effortlessly manipulate elemental forces, enabling them to elicit reversed outputs by supplying negative inputs. With dedication and training, they can even wield both positive and negative energies simultaneously, unleashing potent reactions of unparalleled magnitude.
