**Metadynamic Energies: Foundations of Existence in [[Aeloria]]**

*Overview:*
In the intricate tapestry of [[Aeloria]]'s reality, the very essence of existence is shaped by metadynamic energies. These foundational energies serve as the building blocks for a hierarchy of forces, including meta-elemental energies, elemental energies, and beyond.

*Two Fundamental Types: existential and Non-existential Energies*
Metadynamic energies can be classified into two primary types: Existential and Non-existential energies. These energies define the duality of reality and non-reality, shaping the very fabric of existence and non-existence.

**Existential metadynamic energy:**
Existential metadynamic energy, or Existence metadynamic energy serves as the blueprint for reality, portraying it as a blank slate waiting to be filled. It intricately describes the meta-elemental energies that manifest within this reality. Both reality and meta-elemental energies are embodiments of existence energy. The [[over-deities]] [[Aena, goddess of kindness, creation and order - The Architect (LG)|Aena]] and [[Kryela, goddess of malice, destruction and chaos - The Undoing (LE)|Kryela]] are, together, the originators of this metadynamic energy, utilizing it to irradiate [[Aeloria]]'s reality. Entities directly created by these [[over-deities]], including [[true gods]] and [[Divine Spark|Divine sparks]], embody extreme levels of existence energy. Those being able to exhibit limited control over specific domains within [[Aeloria]]'s reality.

**Non-existential metadynamic energy:**
In contrast, Non-existential metadynamic energy (also called Non-existence metadynamic energy or anti-existence metadynamic energy ) carries an eldritch nature, emanating from the [[The Far Realm|far realms]] and it's inhabitants, those being cosmic aberrations and elder evils. This metadynamic energy is incomprehensible and behaves in ways inherently incompatible with [[Aeloria|Aelorian]] materials and minds. Entities native to the [[The Far Realm|far realms]], such as elder evils and cosmic aberrations, exude non-existence energy. The interaction of this energy with [[Aeloria|Aelorian]] reality varies—some embodiments prove toxic and harmful, while others coexist or remain indifferent. Different levels of non-existence energy permeate both reality and non-reality, presenting varying degrees of influence across the expansive cosmos of [[Aeloria]].

*Control and Interaction:*
Those capable of generating or creating metadynamic energies, whether existence or non-existence, hold limited levels of control over specific domains within the irradiated areas. The delicate dance between these fundamental forces shapes the very foundations of the mystical realm, giving rise to the diverse energies, entities, and phenomena that populate its reality and non-reality alike.

## Meta-elemental energies text 
**Meta-Elemental Energies in [[Aeloria]]**

*Overview:*
In the mystical realm of [[Aeloria]], the fabric of reality is intricately woven with meta-elemental energies. These forces govern the very essence of existence, influencing everything from matter and energy to entropy, morality, and consciousness.

*Fundamental Nature:*
Meta-elemental energies are the foundational fields that allow the existence of all things, defining their attributes and behaviors. They encompass aspects such as time, space, matter, energy, entropy, consciousness, and morality. Even entities that seem to neither add nor subtract actually engage in both actions through an intricate overlap.

*Hierarchy of Existence:*
The elemental forces, representing various aspects of the world, are constructed from the interplay of two primary meta-elemental forces. These forces serve as the building blocks, and all other entities in [[Aeloria]] are, in turn, constructed from these elemental forces. Defining a comprehensive set of rules for these meta-elemental energies proves challenging due to the similarities in behavior among certain embodiments. Nomenclature becomes a matter of perspective.

*Example: Matter and Anti-Matter:*
A striking example of this complex interplay is the relationship between matter (representing addition meta-elemental energy) and anti-matter (representing subtraction meta-elemental energy). These two can be interchangeably referred to, as they exhibit identical behaviors with each other and within themselves. The distinction between the two depends solely on the observer's point of reference.

*Positive Energy - Addition Meta-elemental energy:*
Representative of the [[Over-Deities|over-deity]] [[Aena, goddess of kindness, creation and order - The Architect (LG)|Aena]], the goddess of kindness, creation, and order ([[Aena, goddess of kindness, creation and order - The Architect (LG)|The Architect]]), positive energy is a meta-elemental force. It serves as the base for entities and phenomena that involve addition, such as the creation of matter, energy, time, and their movements. While not confined to the [[plane of energy]] or life, positive energy is most abundant there, especially at its peak in the [[plane of energy]].

*Negative Energy - Subtraction Meta-elemental energy:*
Representative of the [[Over-Deities|over-deity]] [[Kryela, goddess of malice, destruction and chaos - The Undoing (LE)]], negative energy is another meta-elemental force. It forms the foundation for entities and phenomena associated with subtraction, including the removal of matter, energy, timelessness, and their stagnation. Despite being present in planes like void, darkness, or necromancy, negative energy is most prominent in the [[plane of void]], particularly at its highest levels.
