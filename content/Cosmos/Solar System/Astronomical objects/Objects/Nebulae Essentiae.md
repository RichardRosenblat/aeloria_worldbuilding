## Myths

In the timeless epoch before the existence of living beings—before the graceful fish swam in the crystalline waters, before the vibrant plants adorned the landscapes, and before the majestic deer, elves, dwarfs, and humans walked the lands—all the [[True Gods]] of [[Aeloria]] convened for a grand celebration. This jubilant gathering marked their joyous accomplishments in creating [[Aeloria]] and the heavens that adorned the cosmic realm.

As the [[True Gods]] reveled in their festivities, enchanted by the mirthful atmosphere, an unexpected guest sought to join their revelry—the cosmos itself. Intrigued by the gods' creative endeavors, the cosmos yearned to partake in their jubilation. The gods, in their benevolence, welcomed the cosmos into their midst, inviting it to engage in games, to dance, and to share in the nectar of celebration. Throughout these joyous moments, the cosmos listened intently to the desires of the gods, who harbored the wish to breathe life into their cosmic creation.

Infatuated with the profound concept of beings experiencing life's ebb and flow—life and death, love and hatred—the cosmos, stirred by newfound inspiration, ventured to the center of the divine revelry. There, amidst the cosmic symphony, it began an celestial dance. With every graceful movement, ethereal stardust emanated, swirling in celestial patterns. As the cosmos twirled and spun, the stardust coalesced into magnificent clouds of nebulous brilliance.

It was at that moment that the cosmos approached the divine assembly, revealing the true essence of the [[Astronomical objects|nebulae]] essentiae. Each cloud of stardust, endowed with its unique essence, bore the potential for life, and the cosmos graciously bestowed upon the gods the wisdom to use this stardust to fashion the intricate creatures that would soon roam the enchanting realms of [[Aeloria]]. Thus, the wondrous dance of creation unfolded, intertwining the gods, the cosmos, and the very essence of existence in a harmonious tapestry that would endure throughout the ages.
