# Celestial Wonders in [[Aeloria]]'s [[Solar System]]

In the [[Solar system]] of [[Aeloria]], beyond the traditional planets that orbit [[Solis]] and [[Solis]] itself, a myriad of celestial wonders grace the night skies. These extraordinary phenomena include comets, nebulas, asteroid fields, stellar portals, and more. Each of these entities possesses unique characteristics that captivate the imagination of inhabitants across the realms. 

The celestial bodies have specific categories that are always being redefined and expanded as more cosmic bodies are being discovered
