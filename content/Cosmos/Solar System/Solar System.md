# Solar system

In the vast expanse of [[Aeloria]]'s solar system, a celestial dance unfolds, guided by the radiant glow of a central star that bathes the cosmos in its golden embrace. At the heart of this stellar symphony stands the main star, a beacon of light and warmth that serves as the lifeblood of the entire system.

Circling this radiant [[Solis|sun]] are eight planets, each with its own unique characteristics and mysteries waiting to be unraveled. Some planets boast multiple moons, casting ethereal shadows across their surfaces, while others are adorned with majestic ring systems that shimmer like crowns in the cosmic tapestry.

The dance of celestial bodies extends beyond the planets, as various non-planet entities and phenomena contribute to the mesmerizing spectacle. Perhaps there are distant asteroids, silent wanderers navigating the vastness of space, or [[Astronomical objects|comets]] leaving trails of stardust in their wake. Mysterious phenomena, such as cosmic storms or celestial rifts, add an element of unpredictability to the cosmic theater.

In this realm, the solar system becomes more than a mere astronomical configuration; it becomes a canvas for epic tales and quests, with the planets and celestial bodies serving as waypoints in the grand tapestry of the campaign's exploration and adventure. Each astral body holds the potential for discovery, magic, and the unfolding of the balance of existence in the ever-shifting cosmic ballet.

## [[Days of The Week]]

In [[Aeloria]], every day of the [[Days of The Week|week]] allows for stargazers to see a myriad of celestial bodies, [[Astronomical objects|nebulae]] and stars, but the most intriguing cosmic display are the planets of the solar system that become visible in different [[Days of The Week]] and in different times of the day. Each day of the [[Days of The Week|week]], in turn received it's name based on the planet visible in the sky and the period they are seen in, [[Days of The Week|Glowdusk]], received such name because [[Pyrosphere]] is visible at dusk with it's glowing red light, and so on.
