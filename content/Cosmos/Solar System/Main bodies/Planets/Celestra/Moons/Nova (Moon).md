# Nova

Nova is a moon from [[Celestra]] brimming with vibrant energy, characterized by intermittent bursts of radiant energy that illuminate the celestial realm.

## Name

The celestial body known as Nova derives its name from the awe-inspiring, yet of unknown origins, phenomena observed in the distant starsâ€”Supernovas. The decision to name this moon was inspired by the explosions of light characteristic of Supernovas, which, much like Nova itself, emit bursts of radiant energy that captivate observers in the cosmic expanse. The intermittent surges of luminosity from Nova mirror the spectacular displays witnessed in Supernovas, creating a parallel between the moon's energetic nature and the celestial events that inspired its name. The choice of "Nova" serves as a homage to the cosmic wonders of distant stars, infusing the moon with a sense of grandeur and celestial significance, tying it to the broader tapestry of the universe.

## Description

Nova's essence is defined by its energetic nature, as it releases periodic surges of luminous energy into [[Solar System|Wildspace]], creating a spectacle that captivates those who observe it. Approaching the moon is dangerous as it is constantly bursting with hot searing light, and as objects see themselves getting ever so close to the moon, time seems to not move or move backwards until they aren't heading towards the moon. Ever so often shadows can be seen inside the celestial body's light, showing mysterious signs of possible creatures and structures, deep inside it.

## Appearance in Telescope

When viewed through a telescope, Nova presents itself as a dynamic moon, emanating intermittent bursts of radiant energy. The celestial body's luminous displays contribute to its dynamic and captivating presence in the cosmic tapestry. Around the moon, a halo of light can be seen emanating constant bursts of light with small shadows around it

# Rings

Nova is adorned with unique rings that add to its enchanting cosmic display.

## Composition

The rings of Nova are composed of creation magic and cosmic energy, intricately mixed with various objects and incomplete structures. This composition results in rings that radiate intense luminosity and energetic emanations, adding to Nova's mystical aura.
Through telescopes, Nova's Rings manifest as a halo of vibrant, shimmering light around the moon. Constant bursts of energy and the appearance and disappearance of ruins contribute to the ever-changing and captivating visual display observed from afar.

## Description

Nova's Rings possess a magical property rooted in the manipulation and channeling of the primordial essence of the universe. These rings have the ability to create and summon objects and effects in bursts of wild magic and Creation elemental energy. The interplay of creation magic and cosmic energy within Nova's Rings adds an element of unpredictability to the moon's celestial surroundings, making it a unique and intriguing presence in the vast cosmic expanse.
