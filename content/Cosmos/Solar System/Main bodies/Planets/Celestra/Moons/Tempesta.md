# Tempesta

Tempesta is a moon of [[Celestra]] characterized by its unique surface, a mixture of shattered glass appearing in multiple forms, from terracotta-colored dust as fine as salt to very large glass shards that reach the sky. The glass is often very hot due to friction, adding to the moon's distinctive features.

## Name

The moon is fittingly named "Tempesta," reflecting its tempestuous nature and the turbulent weather conditions that define its essence.

## Description

Tempesta's surface is predominantly composed of terracotta-colored shattered glass, forming vast deserts that stretch across the moon. The interplay of glass and storm systems creates a visually stunning and dynamic environment. Up close, the glass shards exhibit a multitude of colors, giving the shattered surface an otherworldly and captivating appearance. The atmospheric composition contributes to the frequent lightning storms that characterize Tempesta.

### Glass Storms

Tempesta is renowned for its glass storms, where instead of raining water, it rains sharp glass shards taken upwards by the winds. These storms also feature violent lightning, much stronger than on [[Aeloria]]. The lightning can melt the glass together, creating areas of hot, smooth glass. Sometimes, the lightning can melt together the sand in the air, creating pillars of glass that are taken and shattered by the wind. These storms also give rise to dust whirlwinds on the moon.

### Lightning Storms

The moon experiences frequent and intense weather patterns, making it a dynamic and ever-changing celestial body. The turbulent atmosphere gives rise to captivating lightning storms that contribute to the moon's dramatic and electrifying character.

### Atmosphere

Tempesta's atmosphere is composed of a poisonous brownish gas that reacts strongly with water, causing significant explosions. This unique atmospheric composition adds an element of danger to the moon, making exploration and habitation challenging. The volatile nature of the gas creates an environment where caution is essential, and the interplay between the poisonous atmosphere and the shattered, multicolored glass surface contributes to the moon's distinctive and hazardous character. Adventurers and researchers alike must navigate the delicate balance of the poisonous air and the tumultuous weather conditions, adding an extra layer of complexity to the exploration of Tempesta.

## Appearance in Telescope

When observed through a telescope, Tempesta reveals itself as a captivating celestial body with swirling storm systems. The terracotta-colored shattered glass surface creates a mesmerizing contrast, emphasizing the dynamic and turbulent nature of the moon.
