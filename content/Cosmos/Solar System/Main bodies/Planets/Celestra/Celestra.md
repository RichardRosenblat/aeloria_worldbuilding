Celestra, a celestial marvel, shines in the sky with it's thick atmosphere and glowing center. This ghostly planet boasts floating islands and a vast sky, where the pale and thick atmosphere creates a mesmerizing backdrop for its unique features. At its unpredictable core, molten iron erupts, adding a touch of volatility to the celestial spectacle.


## Name
  
Celestra, the celestial marvel, derives its name from the [[Bahamut, God  of Justice and Nobility - The Platinum Dragon (LG)|Bahamut]]'s heavenly abode, [[Mount Celestia|Celestia]]. Legends speak of Celestra as a gateway to the divine realms, where justice and nobility reign. Over time, the term "Celestra" evolved, originally representing [[Mount Celestia|Celestia]] but later embodying the believed portal rather than the destination.

## Myths
### Celestra Creation

In the [[The Calm Age (CA)|Calm Age]], the dragons were brought forth into existence. [[Bahamut, God  of Justice and Nobility - The Platinum Dragon (LG)|Bahamut]], [[Bahamut, God  of Justice and Nobility - The Platinum Dragon (LG)|the Platinum Dragon]] and embodiment of nobility and justice, created the Metallic Dragons. These majestic beings were tasked with safeguarding mortals and their settlements from the unruly forces of the prime elements.

On the opposing side, Tiamat, the Scaled Tyrant and deity of wealth, greed, and vengeance, crafted the Chromatic Dragons. Born with a mission to combat and repel the prime elemental forces, they stood as the frontline warriors in the cosmic struggle.

The dragons wielded remarkable power, captivating even the attention of the gods themselves. Kord, the Stormlord and deity of strength and storms, marveled at the might of these creatures. Impressed by their prowess and acknowledging the glory their victories brought to him, Kord decided to reward them.

Despite the ongoing discord among the gods, Kord bravely chose to bestow a gift upon both [[Bahamut, God  of Justice and Nobility - The Platinum Dragon (LG)|Bahamut]] and Tiamat, even though the latter was considered his adversary. Calling upon his domain of clouds, the Stormlord crafted a sky of pure white clouds for [[Bahamut, God  of Justice and Nobility - The Platinum Dragon (LG)|Bahamut]] to soar. He raised numerous mountains with his own hands and placed them in [[Bahamut, God  of Justice and Nobility - The Platinum Dragon (LG)|Bahamut]]'s sky, providing a tranquil haven for [[Bahamut, God  of Justice and Nobility - The Platinum Dragon (LG)|the Platinum Dragon]]'s repose.

However, the Cloaked Serpent, Zehir, god of darkness, poison, and assassins, seized the opportunity to sow chaos. Crafty and malevolent, Zehir concocted a poison using hogweed and used his dagger to pierce the sky. [[Bahamut, God  of Justice and Nobility - The Platinum Dragon (LG)|Bahamut]]'s once serene sky erupted into flames, burning a fiery red. Zehir concealed himself among the stones, reveling in his treacherous deed.

Witnessing the corruption of his creation, Kord's fury ignited like a tempest. The Stormlord unleashed his wrath upon the mountains in his expanse, his hands surrounded by thunder as he shattered the peaks into fragments. These scattered pieces were then employed to separate the poisoned sky from the rest.

Acknowledging his responsibility for allowing Zehir to corrupt his craft, Kord devised a solution. He transformed the uncorrupted clouds into gateways leading to [[Bahamut, God  of Justice and Nobility - The Platinum Dragon (LG)|Bahamut]]'s celestial abode. These gateways allowed [[Bahamut, God  of Justice and Nobility - The Platinum Dragon (LG)|the Platinum Dragon]] to continue soaring through the sky and find rest in the mountains above the poisoned realm.

Grateful for Kord's intervention, [[Bahamut, God  of Justice and Nobility - The Platinum Dragon (LG)|Bahamut]] deemed the sky, despite its corruption, to be beautiful. He chose to preserve it as a precious gift and set it within the expanse of [[Aeloria]]'s sky. Thus, [[Bahamut, God  of Justice and Nobility - The Platinum Dragon (LG)|Bahamut]]'s sky became a radiant gem, shining brightly in the night sky, a testament to the might of Kord and the enduring beauty born from chaos.
