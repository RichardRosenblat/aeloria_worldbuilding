# Fey Sisters (Binary System)

## Planets
The Fey Sisters, [[Verdantia]] and [[Gelana]], form a captivating binary system with two planets embellished with rings, each with its own unique characteristics and mysteries. The celestial dance between these two planets is a spectacle that has captivated astronomers and adventurers alike. These two are together the third celestial body orbiting the [[Solis|Sun]]

## Orbit

The Fey Sister both orbit in an counterclockwise direction around [[Solis]] and themselves in relation to [[Solis]]' North pole, with little orbital inclination their orbit of the sun and their own orbits are sligtly inclined. (it's direction is equal to most of the other planets, it is seen in a east to west direction in [[Aeloria]])

## Name

The binary system, adorned with the captivating celestial dance of [[Verdantia]] and [[Gelana]], derives its evocative name from the two powerful Fey Queens they represent. [[Verdantia]], embodying the lush and vibrant aspects of nature, stands as the living embodiment of Titania, the revered Queen of the Seelie Court. Her rule symbolizes life, growth, and the harmonious balance of existence. On the contrasting end, [[Gelana]] mirrors the regal presence of the Queen of Air and Darkness, the sovereign ruler of the Unseelie Court. [[Gelana]]'s wintry landscapes and enchanting beauty encapsulate the essence of the unbridled forces of nature, portraying a realm touched by both elegance and mystery.

The binary system, given the moniker "The Fey Sisters," aptly captures the juxtaposition of these two celestial bodies reflecting the opposing nature of their Fey Queens. This nickname serves as a testament to the enchanting allure of Titania and the Queen of Air and Darkness, the supreme rulers of the fairies. While the precise origin of the names [[Verdantia]] and [[Gelana]] remains shrouded in mystery, scholars theorize that they may be remnants of an ancient language, perhaps echoing the names of the twin Fey Queens in a tongue lost to the ages. The binary system, with its mystical origin and celestial choreography, continues to weave a tale of magic, balance, and cosmic beauty within the vast tapestry of [[Aeloria]].

## Myths
### Creation

During the [[The Creation (CR)|Creation Era]], [[Corellon, God of Magic and the Arts - The Spellfather (CG)|Corellon]], the god of Magic, crafted the fairies with the [[Ainulindalë]] song. Seeking greater power, he created the Archfey, but he was still unsatisfied. He then created twin archfeys based of his mothers [[Aena, goddess of kindness, creation and order - The Architect (LG)|Aena]] and [[Kryela, goddess of malice, destruction and chaos - The Undoing (LE)|Kryela]]: Titania, ruling the Seelie Court, and The Queen of Air and Darkness, sovereign of the Unseelie Court. ^7ddf8d

Titania, radiantly benevolent, found love in Oberon, one of the archfeys under her father's creation. In celebration of their union, [[Corellon, God of Magic and the Arts - The Spellfather (CG)|Corellon]] fashioned a celestial gift. He collected one of every herb, plant, tree, and leaf, creating a luminous gem named [[Verdantia]]. This radiant gem adorned the sky, accompanied by a magnificent ring crafted from the ice of the coldest mountain peak.

Envious of her sister's celestial gift, The Queen of Air and Darkness approached [[Corellon, God of Magic and the Arts - The Spellfather (CG)|Corellon]]. With a tender touch, he gathered the essence of snowy clouds and one of every flower in existence, crafting another celestial gem named [[Gelana]]. This gem, infused with a powerful ring of [[Corellon, God of Magic and the Arts - The Spellfather (CG)|Corellon]]'s own magic, joined the celestial ballet above.

Thus, the Twin Sisters Binary system was born — a cosmic dance of [[Verdantia]] and [[Gelana]], symbols of the delicate balance between light and shadow in the [[Feywild]]. The rings of ice and magic embellish these celestial bodies, captivating the hearts of all who gaze upon the enchanting ballet of the Fey Sisters.
