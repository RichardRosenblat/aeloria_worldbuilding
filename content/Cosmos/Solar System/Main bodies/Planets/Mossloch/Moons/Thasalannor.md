# Thasalannor

Thasalannor is a moon orbiting the planet [[Mossloch]], characterized by a series of colossal underwater sinkholes known as Abyssal Chasms. These chasms create a network of brine rivers and pools, making navigation perilous and exploration challenging.
## Name

The moon is named Thasalannor, and its nomenclature traces its origins to the ancient word "Thalassa," which means depths. The name encapsulates the essence of the moon's unique and profound underwater landscape, with the ancient language reflecting the moon's connection to the intricate abyssal chasms and the mysteries that lie within the depths of Thasalannor.
## Description

Thasalannor's surface is perpetually covered in a shallow layer of water, with ankle-high levels during low tide and rising to hip-high levels during high tide. The moon experiences regular tidal fluctuations, and despite the aquatic surface, it has a breathable atmosphere that gives rise to a nearly translucent, blueish-tinted sky. The moon enjoys a perpetually tropical climate, with small breezes and mild temperatures prevailing over the entire moon. At the poles, the temperature is somewhat colder, leading to unique ice formations and contrasting conditions.

## Surface

### Tidal Fluctuations
The moon's surface undergoes regular tidal fluctuations, creating a ever-changing water level. During low tide, the water level is ankle-high and during high tide, the water level rises significantly reaching hip-height, contributing to the interconnected expanse of shallow water over the sand.

### Breathable Atmosphere and Translucent Sky
Despite the aquatic surface, Thasalannor has a breathable atmosphere that results in a blueish-tinted sky, creating a visually stunning landscape.

### Tropical Weather
Thasalannor enjoys a perpetually tropical climate, characterized by small breezes and mild temperatures that prevail over the entire moon.

### Weak Currents and Dangerous Tides
While most currents and waves on the surface are weak, during high tide, they become more pronounced and can be dangerous. All currents flow toward the nearest Abyssal Chasm, creating powerful undertows that can pull unwary travelers into the depths below.

### Surface Ecosystem
The surface of Thasalannor supports a limited ecosystem, with only the smallest fishes able to navigate freely in the ankle-to-hip-high waters. These agile and small aquatic creatures are adapted to the moon's shallow and ever-changing environment.


## Sinkholes

### Underwater Sinkholes

The Abyssal Chasms act as entrances to a complex subterranean world beneath the moon's surface. Each sinkhole leads to a labyrinthine system of tunnels and caverns filled with brine pools and rivers, creating an intricate and hazardous underwater environment.

### Strong Underwater Currents

The currents near the borders of the sinkholes are notably stronger, posing a challenge to adventurers attempting to explore the caves. These currents intensify around 50 meters deep but subside at approximately 200 meters, creating a zone of heightened danger and complexity.

## Caves

### Confusing and Winding Caves

The caves beneath Thasalannor's surface are a labyrinthine network, confusing and winding. Navigating through these caves requires careful consideration of the currents, depth, and the ever-changing underwater landscape.

### Stagnated Water

Beyond 200 meters, the water inside the caves becomes stagnant, devoid of the currents that characterize the shallower depths. This stagnant water creates an eerie, quiet environment inside the caves, contrasting with the turbulence near the entrances. The only flow can be seen at the brine rivers on the caves

### Brine Infiltration

Brine starts to appear around 500 meters, initially as small creeks flowing through the cave bottoms and sometimes flowing into small puddles at the sides of the caves. The frequency and volume of brine increase with depth, eventually filling parts of the tunnels. At 1 kilometer deep, colossal caves emerge, housing seas of brine that coexist with regular water.

### Rarity of Water

Beyond the colossal caves, regular water becomes rare, existing only in pockets trapped within the brine-filled caves. These isolated water pockets become valuable resources for adventurers exploring the moon's depths.

### Gravity and Pressure

Thasalannor's slightly stronger gravity contributes to escalating pressure as adventurers descend into the moon's sinkholes, adding an additional layer of difficulty to underwater exploration.

### Crystal Formations
Salt precipitates in the caves, forming intricate crystal formations. These crystals are brittle and come in a myriad of sizes, ranging from a few inches to miles long. The caves' crystalline beauty contrasts with the challenging conditions, offering both peril and wonder to those who dare to explore.
## Poles

At the poles, the temperature is somewhat colder, leading to rain and snow, creating unique ice formations and contrasting conditions. These polar areas provide a distinct environment for exploration, standing in stark contrast to the rest of the moon.

## Appearance in Telescope

When observed through a telescope, Thasalannor reveals a captivating celestial spectacle. The moon's surface, perpetually covered in ankle-to-hip-high water, creates a mesmerizing reflection of the clear, azure sky above. The translucent atmosphere imparts a faint blueish tint to the entire moon, accentuating the ethereal nature of its aquatic landscape. Notably, the telescope captures the defining features of Thasalannor â€” the sinkholes that punctuate its surface. These deep, circular indents manifest as vibrant blue spots, their hues intensified by the interplay of light and water. The viewer glimpses the intricate dance of currents near the borders of these sinkholes, giving a dynamic and ever-changing aspect to the moon's appearance. The celestial body, adorned with its enigmatic blue craters, invites contemplation and sparks the imagination of those who peer through the lens into Thasalannor.
