# Abyssalite

Abyssalite is a moon of [[Mossloch]] shrouded in mystery, with impenetrable dark clouds and deep oceans that hold unexplored abysses. The entire celestial body is veiled in an enigmatic atmosphere, where powerful currents swirl around its core, creating a cosmic dance of darkness and intrigue.

## Name

The moon is aptly named "Abyssalite," a title based on the word "Abyss" that perfectly encapsulates the profound mysteries and enigmas that shroud this celestial body. The name reflects the impenetrable dark clouds and the deep, unexplored abysses that characterize Abyssalite. It beckons to the unfathomable depths of the moon's core, where three enormous dark crystals spin amidst constant electric arcs, emitting a faint amber light. The moniker captures the essence of the reversed lightning phenomena beyond the thick clouds and the perpetual cosmic dance within Abyssalite, evoking a sense of otherworldly allure that resonates with the moon's captivating and mysterious nature.

## Description

The moon's outer layer is dominated by thick clouds, approximately 10 km in depth. Beyond the 5 km mark, a peculiar phenomenon occurs across the moon. Reversed lightning, sudden flashes of darkness with faint green glows at their edges, accompany otherworldly high-pitched noises that cool down the atmosphere and its surroundings. These atmospheric disturbances add to the mystique of Abyssalite, creating an ethereal display for those brave enough to venture close.

As one pierces through the impenetrable clouds of Abyssalite, the moon's core reveals itself. Three enormous dark crystals, seemingly locked in place in relation to one another, become visible. These crystals spin rapidly, moving the dark clouds with them, while constant electric arcs spark around and between them. The crystals emit a faint amber light, with scattered lights inside, illuminating the inner depths of the moon. The constant motion of the crystals and the accompanying lightning create a mesmerizing and ominous spectacle within Abyssalite's core.

The moon's atmosphere spins relentlessly in a consistent direction, featuring small vortexes that traverse the celestial body in a matter of minutes. The atmosphere itself undergoes multiple rotations, contributing to the perpetual motion and cosmic drama of Abyssalite.

Abyssalite is not merely a celestial body with clouds and crystals; it also boasts an ocean that defies conventional understanding. This ocean, unlike any on [[Aeloria]], is a liquid wormhole that travels through the moon's atmosphere and clouds. It appears as a blob of liquid that soars through the moon, breaking apart into multiple blobs that later rejoin. The surface of the liquid wormhole constantly changes, resembling [[Solar System|Wildspace]] with stars, galaxies, [[Astronomical objects|nebulae]], and planets. However, the liquid wormhole serves as a temporal gateway, capable of transporting objects and beings through time to different periods. Caution is warranted, as the relative speeds between objects and the liquid wormhole can result in slicing phenomena during attempted passages.

In addition to the dynamic atmosphere and liquid wormhole, Abyssalite harbors inert dark matter, an invisible and exceedingly dense substance. This dark matter, often resembling invisible sand and dust, floats around the moon's atmosphere, particularly in the higher regions of the clouds. Its collision with anything attempting to penetrate the moon's atmosphere contributes to the legendary "impenetrable clouds" reputation of Abyssalite. Periodically, sizable chunks of dark matter can be found, obliterating anything unfortunate enough to encounter them.

The moon is not devoid of life; flying creatures inhabit its mysterious realms. These creatures carry a small singularity within themselves, using it to bend light and make themselves virtually invisible. The singularity grants them unique abilities related to black holes, such as emitting hot gas and manipulating gravity and light. These creatures have an innate ability to detect each other and the presence of dark matter through unknown means, adding an additional layer of intrigue to the already captivating moon.

## Appearance in Telescope

When observed through a telescope, Abyssalite appears as a moon with a pitch-black swirling cloud surface. The thick and opaque clouds make it challenging to discern any specific details, leaving observers with a sense of wonder and curiosity about the secrets hidden beneath the enigmatic facade of this celestial body.
