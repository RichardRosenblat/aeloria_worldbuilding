# Grimmora

Grimmora, a desolate celestial body, stands as a stark contrast to the vibrant life found in other realms. This barren planet, devoid of atmosphere and teeming with jagged rocks and craters, presents a harsh and inhospitable landscape. The heart of Grimmora unveils a vast underground cave system, dominated by a colossal dark lake that adds an eerie touch to the planet's desolation.

## Myth

In the records of cosmic lore, Grimmora stands as a mysterious enigma, veiled in a cloak of silence that few dare to disturb. 
### Creation

The planet's origin is a nebulous tale, seldom spoken of in the realms of myths and stories. Whispers among celestial scholars suggest that Grimmora's existence was hardly acknowledged until the [[The Era of Ascensions (EA)|Era of Ascensions]], a time when the nefarious Vecna ascended to godhood, casting a shadow across the multiverse. It is said that Grimmora manifested in the cosmic expanse shortly after Vecna's ascent, as if it were a pawn in the whispered one intricate machinations. The scarce rumors that linger tell of an otherworldly connection between Vecna's newfound divinity and the emergence of this desolate celestial body. As Grimmora remains a realm untouched by the vibrant tales of the past, its purpose and origin remain obscured in the cosmic mysteries that only the boldest adventurers might seek to unveil.

## Name

Grimmora earned its ominous name due to the unforgiving nature of its surface, which elicits a sense of grim foreboding for those who lay eyes upon it. The desolate landscape, marked by jagged rocks, craters, and a lack of vibrant colors, creates an inhospitable and stark environment. Observers, whether through telescopes or in person, can't help but feel a chilling discomfort as they witness the barren expanse and the eerie darkness that shrouds the colossal underground lake.
