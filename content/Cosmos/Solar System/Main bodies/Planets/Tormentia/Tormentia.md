# Tormentia

Tormentia, a majestic gas giant, dominates the cosmos with its swirling multicolored storm clouds that dance incessantly, occasionally solidifying into crystalline lightning storms. At its core lies an enigmatic source of magic, manifested through the planet's chaotic and vibrant atmosphere.

## Name

The name Tormentia finds its origin in the ancient roots of a language long lost to the passages of time. Derived from the word "Torquere," meaning "twist" in that ancient tongue, the planet's appellation has undergone a transformation reflective of the linguistic evolution over the centuries. As civilizations rose and fell, languages adapted, and the resonance of the original term evolved into the present-day Tormentia. This shift encapsulates the dynamic nature of language, mirroring the turbulent and ever-changing atmosphere that defines the celestial entity itself.

### Tormentia's Creation

In the wake of the serpent's treachery, [[Kord, God of Strength and Storms - The Stormlord (CN)|Kord]], fueled by anger and determination, returned to his divine craftsmanship. Recalling the insult inflicted by Zehir, the god of serpents, [[Kord, God of Strength and Storms - The Stormlord (CN)|the Stormlord]] gazed upon the gift he had initially begun crafting for Tiamat. It was a realm of colorful skies, woven from the very palette [[Corellon, God of Magic, Spring, Creativity and the Arts - The Spellfather (CG)|Corellon]], [[Corellon, God of Magic, Spring, Creativity and the Arts - The Spellfather (CG)|The Spellfather]], and God of beauty, art, and magic, had used to paint the most enchanting landscapes in [[Aeloria]]. ^8b998b

With a seething resolve, [[Kord, God of Strength and Storms - The Stormlord (CN)|Kord]] named Tiamat's sky "Tormentia" and adorned it as a radiant gem above the [[Aeloria|Aelorian]] heavens. However, Zehir, consumed by jealousy, sought to corrupt this masterpiece as well. Using Belladonna, he crafted a poison that would turn the sky pitch black and shroud the clouds in a thick fog, attempting once again to unleash chaos.

This time, [[Kord, God of Strength and Storms - The Stormlord (CN)|Kord]] was prepared. Transforming into a colorful lightning, he streaked through Tormentia. As Zehir's poison touched the sky, the lightning traversed through it, paralyzing the snake god and stunning him with a burst of thunderous light.

Reverting to his godly form, [[Kord, God of Strength and Storms - The Stormlord (CN)|Kord]] approached the paralyzed Zehir, waiting for the serpent to recover. [[Kord, God of Strength and Storms - The Stormlord (CN)|The Stormlord]] believed in the honor of a fair fight over a cowardly ambush. Once Zehir regained his senses, [[Kord, God of Strength and Storms - The Stormlord (CN)|Kord]] seized the moment, grabbing the cloaked serpent and delivering a powerful punch that resonated with thunder. The impact was so intense that the clouds of Tormentia were stripped away, scattering throughout the sky in an explosion of unimaginable color, and Tormentia fell from the heavens. The thunderous punch echoed across all realms, reaching the ears of gods and mortals alike.

The lightning's potency burned Zehir's scales until they resembled obsidian. In a cowardly retreat, Zehir transformed into thousands of snakes, vanishing into the shadows, swearing vengeance on [[Kord, God of Strength and Storms - The Stormlord (CN)|the Stormlord]].

Satisfied that justice was served, [[Kord, God of Strength and Storms - The Stormlord (CN)|Kord]] summoned back the clouds of Tormentia and presented the restored gift to Tiamat. Once again, he placed it in the celestial expanse of [[Aeloria]]'s heavens, a gem of swirling colors, a testament to [[Kord, God of Strength and Storms - The Stormlord (CN)|the Stormlord]]'s might and commitment to justice.
