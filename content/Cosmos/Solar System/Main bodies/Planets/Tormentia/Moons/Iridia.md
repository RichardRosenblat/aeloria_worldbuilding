# Iridia

Iridia is a captivating moon of [[Tormentia]], distinguished by its radiant crystal formations that create mesmerizing patterns as they reflect and refract light. The moon's surface is dark, adorned with crystals that protrude, giving it a unique and enchanting appearance. At the moon's north pole, a significant portion is missing, unveiling its hollow nature, reminiscent of a geode. 

## Name

The celestial body Iridia derives its name from the captivating term "iridescent," reflecting the moon's enchanting and ever-changing play of colors. The choice of this name encapsulates the essence of Iridia's surface, adorned with radiant crystals that refract and reflect light in a stunning array of hues. The term "iridescent" perfectly captures the dynamic and mesmerizing nature of the moon, evoking a sense of wonder and magic that defines its celestial presence. As observers gaze upon Iridia, the name becomes a fitting tribute to the moon's unique qualities, where the interplay of light and crystal formations creates a celestial spectacle reminiscent of the iridescence found in the most enchanting natural phenomena.

## Description

The moon's exterior is adorned with crystals that not only embellish its surface but also play a crucial role in the moon's ecosystem. These crystals scatter light in intricate patterns, creating a spectacle of colors that dance across the moon's surface. Of particular note is the hollow interior, entirely comprised of crystals that intensify the scattered light. Strikingly, the concentration of light converges into a single point, radiating heat throughout the entire moon. Intriguingly, any non-crystalline living creature that comes into contact with this radiant focal point undergoes a transformation, turning into crystal.

### Hollow Interior

The hollow interior of Iridia is a mesmerizing realm entirely composed of crystals. These crystals form a intricate network that scatters and amplifies the light from the moon's exterior. The convergence of light into a single point within the moon's core not only contributes to its unique appearance but also serves as a source of heat that emanates throughout the moon.

### Crystal Creatures

Within the low-gravity environment of Iridia, crystal creatures inhabit its surface. These beings, entirely made of crystal, interact using electric sparks and resonate with sounds carried through the moon's thin atmosphere. The crystal creatures contribute to the moon's vibrant ecosystem, their forms and movements adding to the enchantment of Iridia's high-fantasy landscape.

#### Interaction with Non-Crystal Entities

Non-crystalline living creatures that venture onto Iridia's core face a unique fate. Instead of burning in contact with the intense crystal light, they undergo a transformation, turning into crystal entities themselves. This magical phenomenon adds an element of mystery and danger to the moon, as the crystalline landscape is shaped by the interplay between light, crystals, and the living entities that inhabit Iridia.

## Appearance in Telescope

Observing Iridia through a telescope unveils a celestial body adorned with sparkling crystals that pierce the moon's dark surface. The missing portion at the north pole provides a glimpse into the moon's hollow interior, where crystals refract light intensely, creating a captivating display. The sight through the telescope showcases the interplay of darkness and radiant crystal formations, making Iridia a celestial gem in the night sky.
