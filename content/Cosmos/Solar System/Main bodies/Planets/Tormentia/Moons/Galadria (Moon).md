# Galadria

Galadria is a moon of [[Tormentia]] with enchanting bioluminescent flora that casts a captivating glow, turning the night into a mesmerizing display of colors.

## Name

Galadria, the moon's name, carries a profound and enchanting history rooted in elven legend. According to ancient tales, the moon draws its name from the captivating story of Galadria, a beautiful elven woman. This ethereal being was once tragically kidnapped and imprisoned, her radiance dimmed by the shackles of captivity. In her darkest hour, she struck a desperate bargain with The Moonweaver, the goddess presiding over the moon. In exchange for her devotion and service, The Moonweaver granted her freedom. Through years of unwavering dedication, the elven woman earned a celestial sanctuary—a home in the skies above, where she could wander freely in a world that would never succumb to darkness.

The name Galadria thus encapsulates not only the moon's physical beauty but also the echoes of a resilient spirit that found liberation through divine intervention. It serves as a testament to the enduring power of hope and the transformative influence of celestial beings in the lives of those touched by their magic.
