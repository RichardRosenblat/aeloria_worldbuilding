# Ravenna

Ravenna, a mysterious moon of [[Tormentia]] shrouded in dense fog, elicits an aura of enigma and dread. The haunting presence of eerie apparitions contributes to the moon's unsettling atmosphere, making it a realm of mystery and foreboding.

## Name

The name "Ravenna" draws its inspiration from the moon's predominant characteristics and its enigmatic essence. Derived from ancient lore and the observations of celestial scholars, "Ravenna" encapsulates the haunting essence of this moon. The name reflects the pervasive fog that veils Ravenna, reminiscent of the mysterious and foreboding nature of the moon. Additionally, it pays homage to the deep chasms and ravines that define its landscape, hinting at the eerie allure and the inexplicable mysteries concealed within its misty shroud. This name, whispered in the records of cosmic exploration, echoes the enigma that Ravenna embodies, inviting adventurers and scholars alike to uncover its secrets while acknowledging the veil of uncertainty that enshrouds this celestial entity.

## Description

Ravenna's landscape is characterized by the persistent shroud of thick fog that blankets its surface. Within this otherworldly mist, deep chasms and ravines are scattered across the moon, adding to its eerie charm. These ravines serve as haunting abodes for skeletal creatures, dwelling within the walls and lurking in the shadows. The skeletal inhabitants, remnants of an ancient and cursed past, are hostile to any non-undead creatures they encounter. With an insatiable thirst to absorb life force, they relentlessly attack, their bony forms animated by an unquenchable hunger. As they succeed in their macabre task, the ravines expand, and new skeletal creatures emerge, perpetuating a cycle of haunting growth.

In the perpetual gloom of Ravenna's fog, the eerie apparitions that haunt the moon add an additional layer of mystique. These ethereal entities, remnants of forgotten souls, manifest as fleeting shadows and ghostly figures. Their presence intensifies the air of mystery, as they drift through the fog, whispering echoes of long-forgotten tales and contributing to the moon's spectral ambiance. Together, the fog, ravines, and haunting apparitions create a tapestry of haunting beauty and dread that defines the unique character of Ravenna.

Ravenna's atmosphere is a delicate veil, existing in a tenuous balance between the ethereal fog that enshrouds the moon and the void beyond. The thinness of the atmosphere becomes apparent as one ventures beyond the comforting embrace of the fog. Outside its protective cover, the air becomes progressively thinner, making it inhospitable for any form of life. It is within the enigmatic fog that the atmosphere attains a unique quality, becoming just thick enough to sustain breath and life. As if holding its breath, the moon's atmosphere mirrors the mysterious nature of Ravenna itself, creating a stark contrast between the breathable sanctuary within the fog and the inhospitable emptiness that lurks beyond its comforting embrace.
