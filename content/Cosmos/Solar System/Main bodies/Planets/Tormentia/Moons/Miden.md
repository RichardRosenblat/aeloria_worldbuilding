# Miden

Miden is a celestial body, a moon of [[Tormentia]], enveloped in a vast desert that sprawls across a significant portion of its surface. Diverse biomes dot the landscape, creating a tapestry of environments. However, the exploration of these varied regions remains a formidable challenge due to the pervasive presence of Miden's defining feature—the enigmatic force known as The Perpetual.

## Name

Miden, the celestial body shrouded in enigma and guarded by The Perpetual, bears a name that reflects the essence of its mystique. Originally christened Midora'hoen by the discoverers, the Harukaze elves, this name embodies a profound symbolism rooted in the elven dialect from that region.

### Origin of the Name

The name Midora'hoen was crafted by combining four distinct words, each contributing to the moon's essence:

- **Mido**: Mystery
- **Ora**: Lasting
- **Ho**: Fire
- **En**: Glow

### Meaning

Collectively, Midora'hoen translates to "The Eternal Mystery of the Fiery Glow." This evocative name captures the enduring enigma and the radiant energy that defines Miden. The combination of "Mystery" and "Lasting" speaks to the perpetual allure and timeless secrets veiled within the moon. "Fire" and "Glow" convey the fiery, luminescent energy emitted by The Perpetual, encapsulating the celestial body's ethereal radiance.

## Evolution to Miden

Over time, the name Midora'hoen underwent a natural transformation, gradually shortening to the more concise "Miden." This simplified moniker retains the essence of the original name while offering a more accessible and familiar designation for those who navigate the stories and mysteries surrounding this captivating moon. Thus, Miden stands as a testament to the fusion of elven heritage and the evolving linguistic landscape, encapsulating the eternal allure of the moon's fiery glow in a single, resonant word.

## Description

The moon Miden is shrouded in The Perpetual, a magical aura emanating red and yellow energies that unleash extreme elemental and radioactive forces upon any entity that ventures too close. This formidable energy barrier renders any approach of the moon for exploration of Miden's diverse biomes nearly impossible. The surface of the moon is adorned with structures, creatures, and objects, including statues, pyramids, and colossal remnants of unidentified constructions, hinting at a rich and mysterious history.

## The Perpetual

The Perpetual is an enigmatic force that blankets the moon Miden, shrouding it in a mysterious and deadly aura. This all-encompassing energy, named for its persistent and unyielding nature, emits an unknown type of energy in a self-renovating pattern, further intensifying its mystique. The Perpetual is unlike any recorded energy in the [[solar system]], bearing a resemblance to arcane elemental energy while incorporating additional, unidentified types of power.

### Properties

The Perpetual exhibits properties that defy understanding, making it a subject of fervent speculation among scholars and mystics alike. The force is believed to be sentient, reacting intensely to any approaching bodies, particularly ships or travelers. Intriguingly, The Perpetual showcases a disabling effect on various forms of technology, both magical and non-magical, preventing any means of approach to the moon, even jamming simple mecanical devices like levers. This relentless force even disrupts magical attempts to breach its barrier, manifesting as a formidable defense mechanism.

### Mysterious Origins

The origin of The Perpetual's power remains a mystery, giving rise to numerous theories. Some propose it as a curse, others speculate about advanced technology, and there are even conjectures suggesting it might be a sentient divine being devoted to safeguarding the moon. The force also inexplicably provides heat to Miden, an effect whose roots defy explanation.

### Gravitational Lensing and Celestial Conjectures

The lensing effect surrounding Miden, attributed to The Perpetual, contributes to the moon's cosmic allure. Scholars report glimpses of different planets within the lensing, leading to theories suggesting that Miden might be a celestial body from another star system. This tantalizing possibility fuels further exploration into the moon's cosmic origins.

### Possible sentience

The Perpetual, with its intricate and self-renewing patterns, has sparked speculation among scholars regarding its sentience. Observations of its behavior, especially the intensification of patterns in response to threats to Miden, fuel the theory that The Perpetual possesses a form of consciousness. The moon's sanctuary appears to trigger a defensive response, suggesting a sentient awareness that manifests in the intricate dance of its energies. Despite numerous attempts to communicate with The Perpetual yielding no discernible results, the notion of its sentience persists, challenging conventional understanding.

Efforts to establish a line of communication with The Perpetual have proven futile, leaving the question of its sentience unanswered. One notable theory proposed by a leading scientist posits that The Perpetual might be alive, but in a manner divergent from any life form known within the [[solar system]]. The scientist suggests that The Perpetual exists in a realm of gradual and imperceptible rhythms, breathing and thriving at a pace beyond the comprehension of beings accustomed to swift and ephemeral lifecycles. It is likened to the slow, enduring pulse of the Earth beneath our feet or the abstract concept of life itself—simultaneously living and decaying in a perpetual dance.

In the quest to understand The Perpetual's sentience, scientists delve into the essence of life, exploring the possibility that it operates on a scale inconceivable to beings with limited lifespans. The patterns and reactions exhibited by The Perpetual might be manifestations of a profound and incomprehensible consciousness, deeply connected to the very fabric of existence. While communication remains elusive, the enigma of The Perpetual persists, challenging the boundaries of understanding and inviting further exploration into the mysterious nature of this celestial guardian.

### Unyielding Protection

The Perpetual's protective capabilities extend beyond technological disruptions. Any creature approaching Miden is met with a destructive force, burning even those resistant or immune to fire. Elemental beings made of pure fire or light find no sanctuary, succumbing to The Perpetual's unrelenting defense. Nearby creatures also exhibit signs of discomfort, with wild beings instinctively avoiding the moon's orbit. Emotionally sensitive beings describe intense feelings of longing, foreboding, and melancholic nostalgia, painting a vivid tapestry of emotional responses to the indomitable force that is The Perpetual. Despite the myriad theories and speculations, one unassailable truth remains—the Perpetual stands as an unwavering guardian, continuously protecting Miden from all that seeks to approach.

## Moon Surface of Miden

The surface of Miden, the moon enveloped by The Perpetual, remains a tantalizing mystery, largely inaccessible to in-person exploration due to the formidable barrier that thwarts any attempts to breach its sanctum. Despite this impediment, the translucent nature of The Perpetual allows for thorough studies through telescopic observation.

### Biomes and Terrain

Miden's surface unfolds as an extensive desert, punctuated by small areas of snow at its poles. The predominant landscape is arid, with vast stretches of many colors of sand, interspersed with peculiar ruins and high rock formations linked to colossal mega-fauna skeletons. Various arid biomes paint the moon's canvas, each contributing to the overall enigmatic allure.

### Man-Made Structures

The moon's surface is adorned with numerous structures, hinting at the presence of intelligent beings. These structures stand as a unique anomaly in the [[solar system]], diverging from the [[Aeloria|Aelorian]] creations attributed to [[Merlin]]. The fascination with exploring Miden arises from the mysterious origins of these structures, and it remains unclear whether the creators are descendants of [[Aeloria|Aelorian]] ancestors or an entirely distinct species. The fate of the builders, whether still present on Miden or alive, remains an enigma.

### Ruins and Technological Marvels

Among the myriad structures, colossal ruins made from materials uncommon to the moon's composition captivate the observer. Advanced technology is apparent in these structures, featuring colossal metallic fish and birds with luminous fins. Copper statues of humanoid creatures, circular structures, destroyed cities, and metallic domes and piramids dot the lunar landscape. Some ruins take the form of watchtowers, while others resemble buried gateways. Floating ruins suspended in the atmosphere further deepen the mystery, their purpose eluding comprehension.

### Signs of Past Life and Extinction

Evidence of a bygone era is scattered across the moon's surface in the form of colossal serpent-like skeletons, suggesting a significant extinction event. Despite this, patterns of dust rising in the wake of swift movements hint at the potential existence of creatures alive on the moon. The surface is teeming with untold purposes and secret stories, waiting to be unraveled by intrepid explorers seeking to unveil the mysteries concealed within Miden's lunar expanse.

## Appearance in Telescope

When observed through a telescope, Miden presents itself as a mesmerizing celestial body emitting a glowing red and yellow light. The faint surface of the moon is glimpsed behind this ethereal radiance, creating a surreal and captivating spectacle for those who gaze upon it. The gravitational lensing effect at the moon's edges further contributes to the mysterious and enchanting appearance observed from afar.
