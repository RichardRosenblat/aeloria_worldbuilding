# Duskar

Duskar, a moon of [[Tormentia]] shrouded in perpetual twilight, presents a captivating spectacle with its unique atmospheric conditions and mysterious landscapes. The clouds of Duskar continuously display a myriad of colors, creating an eternal sunset effect. A mysterious mist covers most of the moon's surface, adding an enigmatic aura to its appearance.

## Name

Duskar derives its evocative name from a seamless blend of "dusk" and "scar," each element symbolizing a distinctive facet of the moon's character. "Dusk" embodies the perpetual twilight that bathes the moon, creating an eternal and enchanting gloaming atmosphere. Meanwhile, "scar" draws inspiration from the colossal crater at Duskar's equator, resembling a prominent mark or scar on the lunar surface. This harmonious fusion captures the essence of the moon, encapsulating its perpetual twilight and the distinctive feature of the equatorial crater, resulting in the resonant and poetic moniker of Duskar.

## Description

Duskar, a moon of eternal twilight, showcases a captivating tableau with ever-changing, sunset-hued clouds and a mysterious mist. The desolate, pale grey terrain is marked by withered plants and hazardous lakes. Governed by opposing elemental forces, Duskar exists in eternal twilight, its void-touched landscapes deepening as one ventures further. A colossal equatorial crater, bearing a handprint-shaped enigma, adds to the moon's mystique when glimpsed through a telescope.

### Lunar Landscape

The ground of Duskar is characterized by a pale grey color, featuring withered plants, skeletons of animals, and poisonous lakes of acid brine. Other regions consist of nothing but dust and regolith, contributing to the desolate and inhospitable nature of the moon.

### Elemental Singularity

Duskar possesses a peculiar ability to siphon positive elemental energy into an elemental singularity point at its core. This process leaves the moon charged with negative energy, resulting in an everlasting twilight atmosphere. Even when the [[Solis|sun]] is at its zenith, Duskar appears as if it is in a perpetual twilight.

### Color Muting Effect

The positive energy of the [[Solis|sun]]'s light orbits the planet in an multi-directional accretion disk-like manner, creating a mesmerizing display of colors at it's clouds, simulating an eternal dust, even during high-noon. However, due to the influence of negative energy, all colors become muted on the moon's surface, rendering the world in shades of black and white.

### Nullifying Characteristics

The negative energy influence of Duskar brings the moon closer to absolute void, absorbing characteristics from the elemental [[Plane of Void|Negative Energy Plane]].Physical, biological and magical processes are dampened in the moon, fire burns colder, ice becomes fragile, heat becomes scarce, sound is muffled, attacks are weakened and magic is fragile. Healing becomes increasingly challenging, and as one ventures deeper into the moon, these effects intensify, draining life force from explorers and making healing impossible and magic is nullified. 

### Equatorial Crater

At the moon's equator, a colossal crater stands as a prominent feature. Within the crater, regolith areas are covered in a thick, petroleum-like substance, forming a colossal handprint with five fingers at the center of the crater.

## Appearance in Telescope

When observed through a telescope, Duskar manifests as a moon with faintly glowing clouds displaying a multitude of colors. The stark contrast between the vibrant clouds and the bleak surface, combined with the mysterious mist obscuring most features, creates a captivating and otherworldly sight. The equator crater, marked by the colossal handprint, stands out as a discernible feature amid the moon's enigmatic and haunting appearance.
