# Halcyon

Halcyon is a captivating moon of [[Tormentia]] that unfolds a mesmerizing spectacle of vast oceans and frequent storms. Beneath its turbulent waves lies a diverse marine ecosystem, and peculiarly, the Terragon Leviathans—colossal turtle-like beings that carry entire islands and continents on their backs.

## Name

The name "Halcyon" finds its roots in the ancient Frostfeather song, a melodic tale that reveres a magical bird species known as Halcyon. The song speaks of these mystical birds crafting their nests amidst the tumultuous frozen sea at the northeast of Valdoria, where the Icebound Sea clashes with the relentless storms of the Evergale Sea. In the song, the Halcyon birds, with their enchanting melodies, would calm the raging sea to create a serene haven for laying their eggs. Inspired by the poetic resonance of this narrative, the moon came to be named Halcyon, reflecting the parallel between the bird's soothing influence on the frozen sea and the presence of the majestic Terragon Leviathans that navigate the moon's turbulent oceans. The name encapsulates both the storms that define the moon and the remarkable tranquility brought forth by its extraordinary inhabitants.
