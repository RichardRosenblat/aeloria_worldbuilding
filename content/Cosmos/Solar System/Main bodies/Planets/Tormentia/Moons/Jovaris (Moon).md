# Jovaris

Jovaris is a moon of [[Tormentia]] with a turbulent atmosphere, featuring swirling storms and ever-changing cloud patterns. The moon boasts strong gravity, yet paradoxically, it harbors floating landmasses that serve as islands in the wind. 

## Name

The name "Jovaris" finds its origins in the ancient tales of [[Aeloria]], deeply rooted in the lore surrounding a divine Whirlpool crafted by [[Melora, Goddess of the Wild and Sea - The Wildmother (N)|the Wildmother]], the revered goddess of nature and the sea. Legends speak of the swirling power within this enchanted vortex serving as the goddess's sanctum for her hunting arsenal. Within the depths of Jovaris, [[Melora, Goddess of the Wild and Sea - The Wildmother (N)|the Wildmother]] conceals her array of formidable weapons, infusing them with elemental energy and the essence of life itself. When the call for their use arises, the Whirlpool of Jovaris becomes a conduit, expelling these sacred artifacts, enveloped in a dazzling display of energy and vitality, thus manifesting the divine might of [[Melora, Goddess of the Wild and Sea - The Wildmother (N)|the Wildmother]].

## Description

The atmosphere of Jovaris is chaotic, with gases swirling around singular points, drawing closer to create spheres of compressed air. These spheres generate accretion disks that heat up the surrounding gas, launching it with extreme jets of superheated gas, elemental energy, and radiation. The dynamic movement of these spheres forms a chaotic dance, illuminating the moon's surface like a fast-moving flashlight. However, once these spheres lose their speed, their internal balance is disrupted, resulting in explosive waves of air.

Deep within Jovaris, at higher atmospheric pressures, lies an ocean of liquid that swirls and gives rise to whirlpools. These whirlpools spin so rapidly that they create quasars, launching hot gas, light, elemental energy, and radiation from their centers. This mesmerizing display of bright colors includes quasars in various hues, depending on the minerals present in the water. Some quasars emit blue jets of energy, while others display shades of green, purple, or magenta. As the water accelerates and heats up, it produces bubbles of hot steam. Eventually, the pressure becomes overwhelming, causing the water to transition into a superheated state, only to return to a liquid form.

## Appearance in Telescope

When observed through a telescope, Jovaris presents itself as a moon with dynamic cloud formations and intense atmospheric activity. Across its clouds, shadows can be seen, caused by the big islands of rock floating around it. Ever so often, flashes of light can be seen piercing the moon's atmosphere.
