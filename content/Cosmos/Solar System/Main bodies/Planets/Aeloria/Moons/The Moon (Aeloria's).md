# [[Aeloria]]'s Moon

[[Aeloria]]'s Moon is the solitary celestial companion that graces the night sky, casting its silvery glow and influencing the ebb and flow of the planet's tides.

## Name

The celestial body is simply known as "Moon," a humble yet profound designation reflecting its primordial status as the first celestial entity discovered in the [[Solar System|Aeloria Solar System]]. Although some places refer to her as Sehanine

## Myth
### Equatorial canyon

Tales speak of the might of King [[Arthur Pendragon]], that during one of his experiments with the powerful sword, Excalibur, he was able to slice the moon itself, cutting it in two with the magical sword. The Equatorial canyon of the Moon would be the proof of this

### Creation

Tales recount the genesis of the Moon as created by the delicate hands of Sehanine, the Moonweaver. In the [[The Creation (CR)|Creation Era]] before the celestial body adorned the firmament, the vast expanse of the sky lay barren, leaving a palpable void adorned with small sparkling stars that stirred within the goddess a sense of longing.

As time unfurled its ephemeral tapestry, Sehanine resolved to fill the celestial emptiness with a luminous presence. The Moonweaver embarked on a quest to discover the means to ascend to the heavens. Her celestial journey began by tethering 27 sparrows to strings, a meticulous count to achieve the perfect equilibrium—neither too few to carry her aloft nor too many to burden the innocent avians.

With the sparrows as her ethereal chariot, Sehanine ascended into the night sky. As she gazed downward, a panorama of mortal life unfolded beneath her. Humans reveled in wonder, innocence, and joy. The leaves of trees danced in the nocturnal breeze, and the lights of fireflies sparkled in exuberant celebration, casting their glow upon tranquil lakes.

Enchanted by the beauty of humanity, the Moonweaver also beheld the gradual dimming of their luster as time wore on. The once-vibrant connections between mortals and the wonders of the world dulled, and the goddess felt a profound yearning for the preservation of such ephemeral brilliance.

Guided by the stars, Sehanine traversed the cosmos, encountering myriad planets, each hosting its own denizens. Along her celestial odyssey, she formed bonds and friendships that blossomed and evolved with the passage of time—like the gentle caress of time upon even the sturdiest rocks.

Among the cosmic companions, the Moonweaver encountered a wise fox who imparted profound lessons. From the creature, she learned the intricate tapestry of delight and responsibility that comes with forming attachments. As the time came to part ways, tears flowed from Sehanine's eyes, revealing the poignant truth that the most meaningful aspects of existence are discerned by the heart.

During her celestial sojourn, Sehanine encountered a singular rose—a creation of simplicity and delicacy. The goddess, eternal in her essence, found herself enamored by the ephemeral beauty of the flower. However, aware of the transient nature of the rose, Sehanine relinquished her quest for an everlasting companion.

In a display of profound devotion, Sehanine chose to dwell with the rose, savoring every fleeting day of its existence. Their days were filled with happiness, their love radiating a brilliance that surpassed the celestial skies. As the years unfolded and the rose aged, a day arrived when the once-vibrant flower shed tears.

"Why do you weep?" inquired Sehanine with concern.

"My leaves are heavy, my petals wrinkled. I fear the inevitability of death, the weight of regret, and the thought of being perceived in this withered state. In my youth, I dreamed of breaking free from my roots, longing to dance among the heavenly bodies with you," confessed the rose.

Sehanine, moved by compassion, offered a solution. "I can make your wish come true, but to sever you from your roots will hasten your demise. I fear the loss of you."

The rose gently shook her head. "I, too, fear the parting, for our love, though profound, is bound by the finite threads of existence. I yearn for you, yet I am not destined to be forever yours."

"I wish to stay," Sehanine declared, her voice tinged with both love and sorrow. "I want to witness your joy and be the reason for your smile during each of the remaining days we share." The rose agreed, and they continued to cherish their fleeting moments until the day the rose was no more.

Bearing the weight of grief, Sehanine decided to create a lasting memorial for her beloved rose. She tethered the sparrows to the rose's former abode and carried it to her celestial home, [[Aeloria]]. Naming the rose's dwelling "the Moon," Sehanine orchestrated a cosmic dance, allowing the moon to twirl with [[Aeloria]] in a union that mirrored the dance she and the rose could never share.

In gratitude for the profound experience of love, Sehanine, once a seeker of companionship, became the creator of a celestial spectacle that adorned the skies of [[Aeloria]]—a testament to her enduring love and the memory of her greatest earthly bond.
