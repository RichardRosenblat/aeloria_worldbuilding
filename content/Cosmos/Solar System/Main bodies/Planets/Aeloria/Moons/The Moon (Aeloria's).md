# [[Aeloria]]'s Moon

[[Aeloria]]'s Moon is the solitary celestial companion that graces the night sky, casting its silvery glow and influencing the ebb and flow of the planet's tides.

## Name

The celestial body is simply known as "Moon," a humble yet profound designation reflecting its primordial status as the first celestial entity discovered in the [[Solar System|Aeloria Solar System]]. Although some places refer to her as Sehanine

## Myth
### Equatorial canyon

Tales speak of the might of King [[Arthur Pendragon Of Camelot]], that during one of his experiments with the powerful sword, Excalibur, he was able to slice the moon itself, cutting it in two with the magical sword. The Equatorial canyon of the Moon would be the proof of this

### Creation

Tales recount the genesis of the Moon, crafted by the delicate hands of Sehanine, the Moonweaver. In the [[The Creation (CR)|Creation Era]] before the celestial body adorned the heavens, the sky lay barren, a vast expanse adorned with only small sparkling stars that stirred within the goddess a sense of longing.

As time unfolded its ephemeral tapestry, Sehanine resolved to fill the celestial emptiness with a luminous presence. She embarked on a quest to discover the means to adorn the heavens. Her journey began by tethering 42 sparrows to strings, achieving the perfect equilibrium—neither too few to carry her aloft nor too many to burden the innocent avians.

With the sparrows as her ethereal chariot, Sehanine ascended into the night sky. As she gazed downward, a panorama of mortal life unfolded beneath her. Tallmen reveled in wonder, innocence, and joy. The leaves of trees danced in the nocturnal breeze, and the lights of fireflies sparkled in exuberant celebration, casting their glow upon tranquil lakes.

"How beautiful," Sehanine smiled, her voice a gentle caress upon the night. "This world given by our mothers and tended by my siblings truly is a wondrous place."

Enchanted by the beauty of humanity, the Moonweaver also beheld the gradual dimming of their luster as time wore on. The once-vibrant connections between mortals began to fray, love became tarnished by indifference, hatred festered in the hearts of the envious, and the wonder of innocence was replaced by the weight of experience, their joy became fleeting. The leaves of trees withered and fell, and the lights of fireflies dimmed, casting the tranquil lakes into shadow.

"These mortals of creation, they glow so brightly, yet their light fades with the passage of time. I shall find a way to preserve their beauty, to keep their wick from corroding," Sehanine mused, her heart heavy with the weight of her thoughts. "I must adorn the heavens with a light that will never fade, before I can return to the world below. This light will be eternal and beautiful, so I can mirror it in the world below."

Guided by the stars, Sehanine traversed the cosmos, encountering myriad planets, each hosting its own splendor, secrets and denizens. Along her celestial odyssey, she forged quick friendships with the denizens of the cosmos, learning from them the intricacies of existence and the beauty of the universe.

Among her cosmic companions, the Moonweaver met a wise fox who imparted profound lessons. From the creature, she learned the intricate balance of delight and responsibility that comes with forming attachments. The fox -sitting beneath a tree alongside Sehanine, said, its voice sturdy and wise like an old oak, "To love is to be vulnerable, to give your heart to someone you trust, and this vulnerability cannot be captured in words." The fox's words resonated within Sehanine. "Maybe this love is what I seek, maybe it will never fade, and I will paint my gem in the sky with it, so that it blesses the world below." she thought before the fox continued. "But remember, love is not just a gift; it is a responsibility, a duty to care for the one you love, to see within them what eyes cannot see. The time you spend with them is what makes them special, unique among ten thousand others." concluded the wise fox.

The Moonweaver nodded, as the words of the fox resonated within her mind. "Then I will tend to my light and make sure it always glows strong." she whispered to herself. Sehanine's stay with the fox was the longest of her journey until then. That creature had been the only one that could make her stay for more than a day. With gentle laughter and wise words, the fox was a true friend to the Moonweaver. As the time came to part ways, tears flowed from Sehanine's eyes, as a goodbye gift the fox imparted her with a last bit of wisdom "The most meaningful aspects of existence are not seen by the eyes, but by the heart" and with that, returned to his den and Sehanine continued her journey.

During her celestial sojourn, the goddess landed on a cold and isolated rock floating through the cosmos. There Sehanine encountered a singular flower—a creation of simplicity and delicacy, carrying only five petals of a pastel blue. The goddess, endless by nature and filled with glorious purpose from the beginning of time, found herself mesmerized by the simple beauty of the flower. The flower had no reason to exist there, no purpose to fulfill, yet it was there at the furthest reaches of the cosmos, blooming in the void. A flower without anyone to see it, to appreciate it, or to smell its fragrance.

The flower growing in such a desolate place confused the goddess. She lowered herself to the flower's level, her eyes filled with curiosity. "Why are you here, alone in the void, with no one to see you, small one?" she asked, her voice filled with curiosity. The flower, its petals dancing in the celestial breeze, replied with a voice as soft as the moonlight. "I am here because I exist, as the cosmos is, so am I. That reason is enough for me. Even if no one sees my struggle, I alone bring beauty to this place. The flower before you has no glorious purpose, no grand destiny, unlike your kind, but I will spend my short existence, working to make a diference in this desolate place, until the end. For I need no one to see me, to appreciate me, to smell my fragrance. I am enough for myself."

The words of the flower resonated within Sehanine, her soul stirred by the flower's simple yet profound statement. "You speak with reason, small one. You truly are enough for yourself, and that makes you so special." she replied, her voice filled with admiration. "Allow me to stay here with you and admire your beauty, so it may not be lost to the void. For you do not have the need for others to see you, but I insist on seeing you, as you are truly special and it pains me to think that your beauty will be lost to the uncaring expanse above us." she continued. The flower, had its petals shake in a gentle breeze, as it nodded in agreement. "My words would be tainted with lies if I said that I did not want you to stay with me, for I find joy in your presence and I do not wish to be alone in this place. We have little in common, goddess, but I feel a connection with you, I hope you won't object if I regard you as a friend." the flower replied, its voice filled with warmth.

As time unfolded, the goddess and the flower shared moments of joy, and the Moonweaver found herself enamored by the beauty of the flower that blossomed strongly every day, painting, singing, writing, and working to make her small world a more beautiful place. The flower, in turn, reveled in the goddess's presence, basking in the warmth of her love. The days passed like a gentle breeze, carrying with them the fragrance of the flower and the radiance of the goddess.

"Why have you traveled so to this place, goddess? The home of the other children of your kin is so distant from my horizon, yet you traveled so far." the flower asked her companion. "I search the cosmos for a light that will never fade, never wane, or corrupt itself with time, so that I can then make the children of my kin see it and never let their own light fade," Sehanine answered, watching the stars above. "I will be sure that such light glows forever, with a beauty like yours, so that all can understand the beauty of a world with you." she continued.

The flower shook its petals, a gentle breeze carrying its fragrance to the goddess. "oh, how you misunderstand my beauty, my love. My charm is not in my petals, my fragrance, or my colors. It is in my actions, in my words, in my work that will exist only for the two of us, for this brief life that I have. This intimacy, understanding, and feelings we share for this speck of time we have at this place could never be accurately depicted by any art in the cosmos. Our love is unique, and that is what makes it so special." the flower answered with a gentle smile. Sehanine nodded, her heart heavy with the weight of the flower's words. "I am grateful for your presence, my love. I will cherish every moment we share, for you are truly special to me." she replied, her voice filled with deep love.

Sehanine chose to dwell with the flower, savoring every fleeting day of its existence. Their days were filled with happiness, their love radiating a brilliance that surpassed the celestial bodies yet it was only visible to the two of them. As the years unfolded like a gentle breeze, and the flower aged, a day arrived when the once-young flower shed tears.

"Why do you weep, my dear?" inquired Sehanine with concern.

"My leaves are heavy, my petals wrinkled. I fear the inevitability of death, the weight of regret, and the thought of being perceived in this withered state, by you. I knew that my time was short, but it is hard to accept that the end of my existence is approaching," the flower replied, its voice now shaking as her petals. "In my youth, I dreamed of breaking free from my roots, longing to dance among the heavenly bodies with you." confessed the flower.

Sehanine, moved by compassion, offered a solution. "I can make your wish come true, but to sever you from your roots will hasten your demise. I fear the loss of you."

The flower gently shook her head. "I, too, fear the parting, for our love, though profound, is bound by the finite threads of existence. I yearn for you, yet I am not destined to be forever yours."

"I wish to stay, if you would allow me to," Sehanine declared, her voice tinged with both affection and sorrow. "I want to witness your joy and be the reason for your smile during each of the remaining days we share, so that when you leave me, you will leave with a smile on your face, knowing that you were loved and cherished by me until the very end." she continued.

The flower smiled, agreeing with the goddess's proposal to stay together until the end. The days passed, and the flower's petals began to wilt, its colors fading, and its fragrance diminishing. Sehanine, her heart heavy with grief, watched as the flower's life ebbed away, its petals falling gently to the ground, and then the flower was no more.

Bearing the weight of grief, Sehanine decided to create a lasting memorial for her beloved flower. She had understood that a never-fading light was not

 the answer to the beauty of the world, for there is beauty in even the most fleeting of moments. The Moonweaver, with tears in her eyes, tethered the sparrows to the flower's former abode and carried it to her celestial home, [[Aeloria]].

Naming the flower's dwelling as the Moon, Sehanine blessed the Moon with a heavenly motion, orchestrating a cosmic dance, allowing the Moon to twirl with [[Aeloria]] in a union that mirrored the dance she and the flower could never share. She declared that the light of the Moon would wax and wane, just like the flower's life, so that all could understand the beauty of a light that was fleeting, yet always present.

In gratitude for the profound experience of love, Sehanine, once a seeker of an eternal light, became the creator of a celestial spectacle that adorned the skies of [[Aeloria]].

## Appearance in Telescope

When observed through the lens of a telescope, [[Aeloria]]'s Moon unveils its captivating features. The celestial orb presents itself as a pale, silvery sphere adorned with subtle craters that tell the tales of countless cosmic collisions. A defining characteristic is the expansive canyon that gracefully encircles the moon's equator, adding a touch of celestial grandeur to its surface.
