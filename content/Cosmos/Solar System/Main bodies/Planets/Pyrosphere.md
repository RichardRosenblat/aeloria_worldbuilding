# Pyrosphere

Pyrosphere is the first planet orbiting [[Solis]], it is a blazing planet covered in active volcanoes and streams of molten lava. 

## Name

The name Pyrosphere draws inspiration from the ancient word "Pyros," a term synonymous with fire. This nomenclature aptly encapsulates the essence of the planet as a blazing celestial body dominated by intense heat, molten lava, and volcanic activity. Rooted in the linguistic heritage of fire-related terminology, Pyrosphere conjures images of a world engulfed in the flames of its volcanic landscape. The choice of this name reflects both the linguistic history of elemental forces and the inherent connection between the planet's identity and the powerful, ever-present fires that define its character in the vast cosmos.

## Myths

### Creation

According to the ancient beliefs passed down through the ages, the origin of Pyrosphere is intricately woven into the divine tapestry of [[Moradin, God of Creation, Forgecraft and Legacy - The Allhammer (LG)|Moradin]], the god of forgecraft and creation. In the celestial realm, [[Moradin, God of Creation, Forgecraft and Legacy - The Allhammer (LG)|Moradin]] found himself reliant on the radiant heat of [[Pelor, God of the Sun, Summer and Agriculture - The Dawnfather (NG)|Pelor]], the [[Solis|sun]] god, to fuel his masterful creations. Despite [[Moradin, God of Creation, Forgecraft and Legacy - The Allhammer (LG)|Moradin]]'s gratitude and respect for [[Pelor, God of the Sun, Summer and Agriculture - The Dawnfather (NG)|Pelor]]'s warmth, the stoic god knew that true pride existed only in self-sufficiency.

Driven by an unwavering determination to forge a source of heat independent of [[Pelor, God of the Sun, Summer and Agriculture - The Dawnfather (NG)|Pelor]], [[Moradin, God of Creation, Forgecraft and Legacy - The Allhammer (LG)|Moradin]] embarked on a cosmic endeavor. He reached out into the cosmic expanse, seizing stars that glittered in the night sky. Mixing the fiery essence of these celestial bodies with the very ground beneath his divine feet, [[Moradin, God of Creation, Forgecraft and Legacy - The Allhammer (LG)|Moradin]] infused his own burning blood into the concoction. With unparalleled craftsmanship, [[Moradin, God of Creation, Forgecraft and Legacy - The Allhammer (LG)|Moradin]] crushed and molded the mixture until it radiated with the brilliance of sunfire.

In an awe-inspiring display of divine power, [[Moradin, God of Creation, Forgecraft and Legacy - The Allhammer (LG)|Moradin]] hurled the burning magma into the heavens, creating Pyrosphereâ€”an eternal source of heat that he could perpetually access. The blazing planet became a testament to [[Moradin, God of Creation, Forgecraft and Legacy - The Allhammer (LG)|Moradin]]'s ingenuity and self-sufficiency, a fiery orb in the cosmic ballet, forever fueled by the celestial fires of [[Moradin, God of Creation, Forgecraft and Legacy - The Allhammer (LG)|Moradin]]'s creation.

As the fire giants and dwarves, [[Moradin, God of Creation, Forgecraft and Legacy - The Allhammer (LG)|Moradin]]'s children, emerged into existence, their admiration for the art of forgework caught the god's attention. In response, [[Moradin, God of Creation, Forgecraft and Legacy - The Allhammer (LG)|Moradin]] decided to craft a new mixture, one that would reside at the core of [[Aeloria]], the planet he had forged with his brothers and sisters. This molten core served as a gift to his children, providing them with the raw materials needed for their own works of metallurgy and craftsmanship.

Legend has it that [[Moradin, God of Creation, Forgecraft and Legacy - The Allhammer (LG)|Moradin]], utilizing Pyrosphere as a boundless forge, forged weapons of unimaginable strength. Many of the divine weapons wielded by the gods during [[The Great War (GW)|The Great War]] of the gods were said to have originated from the fiery depths of Pyrosphere. Whispers persist that deep within the planet's core lie remnants of [[Moradin, God of Creation, Forgecraft and Legacy - The Allhammer (LG)|Moradin]]'s failed weapon prototypes, hidden in the searing heart of the world he created. The echoes of divine craftsmanship and the clanging of celestial hammers resonate throughout Pyrosphere, a testament to [[Moradin, God of Creation, Forgecraft and Legacy - The Allhammer (LG)|Moradin]]'s enduring legacy as the celestial blacksmith of the cosmos.

## Moons

Pyrosphere doesn't have any moons orbiting around it.

## Life

Pyrosphere supports life, hosting a unique ecosystem of resilient fire-based creatures that have adapted to the extreme heat and volcanic activity of the planet.

## Temperature

The temperature on Pyrosphere is exceptionally hot, reflecting the intense nature of the planet.

## Diameter

Compared to other celestial bodies, Pyrosphere has a relatively small diameter.
## Oceans

Pyrosphere lacks oceans, and its landscape is dominated by molten lava flows and volcanic terrain.

## Ruins

### Description

Within Pyrosphere's volcanic caves, ancient ruins attributed to [[Merlin of The Stars|Melin]] are discovered. These ruins harness the planet's energy for powerful magical rituals.

### Purpose

The ruins on Pyrosphere serve the dual purpose of safeguarding secrets related to fire-based magic and providing protection against the planet's intense heat.

## Atmosphere

### Type
