# The mythical timeline

This is a timeline created by myths, divine guidance, folklore, epics and tales. It tells stories of the [[True Gods]] and the creation of the world and races.

## The timeline summarized

The creation myth of [[Aeloria]] unfolds in the tumultuous [[The Far Realm|Far Realms]], where [[Over-Deities|cosmic dreamers]] [[Aena, goddess of kindness, creation and order - The Architect (LG)|Aena]] and [[Kryela, goddess of malice, destruction and chaos - The Undoing (LE)|Kryela]] emerge, establishing "[[The Eternal Workshop]]." This realm faces constant threats from aberrations, leading to epic battles among godly beings. A cataclysmic event involving [[Vordo]] and [[Ethedok]] prompts [[Aena, goddess of kindness, creation and order - The Architect (LG)|Aena]] and [[Kryela, goddess of malice, destruction and chaos - The Undoing (LE)|Kryela]] to seal the malevolent force known as "The Red End."

To shield their creation, [[Aena, goddess of kindness, creation and order - The Architect (LG)|Aena]] and [[Kryela, goddess of malice, destruction and chaos - The Undoing (LE)|Kryela]] erect "[[The Greater Limit]]," confining their influence. The [[True Gods]], sent into a void within the workshop, use primordial forces to craft the world. Discord among them gives rise to the "[[Defiant Gods]]" and "[[Harmonious Gods|Harmonious Deities]]," leading to the creation of dragons to combat primordial forces.

The golden age of enlightenment ensues, but unchecked arrogance triggers the return of primordial forces, culminating in "[[The Great War (GW)|The Great War]]." [[Asmodeus, God of Tyranny - The Lord of the Nine Hells (LE)|Asmodeus]] ascends during the conflict, and the [[True Gods]], realizing the consequences, establish the "[[The Divine Accord|Divine Accord]]" with guidelines for non-interference, mortal champions, and balance.

The aftermath sees the rise of new [[True Gods]] like the Raven Queen and Vecna through ascension rituals. [[Aena, goddess of kindness, creation and order - The Architect (LG)|Aena]] and [[Kryela, goddess of malice, destruction and chaos - The Undoing (LE)|Kryela]], concerned about mortal ascensions, reform the world. They reshape [[Corellon, God of Magic and the Arts - The Spellfather (CG)|Corellon]], making him the Guardian of the Weave, regulating magic and preventing further mortal ascensions. To safeguard the world, they erase all traces of magic, temporarily weakening the [[True Gods]]. Mortals adapt to a new era of relative peace and stability, guided indirectly by the distant [[True Gods]] under [[The Divine Accord]].

## The Eons

The mythical timeline is divided in Eons, with each eon divided into Eras, These are the timeline, Eons:
