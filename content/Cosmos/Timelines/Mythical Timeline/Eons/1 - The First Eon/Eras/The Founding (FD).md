## Before the Inception of Time

Before the inception of time itself, there existed only the tumultuous [[The Far Realm|Far Realms]], a plane steeped in madness and surrealism.

## [[Aena, goddess of kindness, creation and order - The Architect (LG)|Aena]] and [[Kryela, goddess of malice, destruction and chaos - The Undoing (LE)|Kryela]]

From the vast abyss of nothingness, [[Aena, goddess of kindness, creation and order - The Architect (LG)|Aena]] and [[Kryela, goddess of malice, destruction and chaos - The Undoing (LE)|Kryela]], two [[Over-Deities|cosmic dreamers]], willed themselves into existence within the [[The Far Realm|Far Realms]]. Their arrival reverberated through every twisted layer of this enigmatic realm, setting reality itself quaking.

## [[The Eternal Workshop]]

Driven by a boundless love for their envisioned creations, they embarked on a profound mission to bring both order and chaos into harmonious existence, crafting a vessel to hold the essence of their boundless creativity.

They staked their claim at the very heart of the [[The Far Realm|Far Realms]], christening their newfound dominion as "[[The Eternal Workshop]]" with easels and rotating bookshelves.

In its infancy, this domain possessed no defined boundaries, leaving it vulnerable to the ceaseless onslaught of aberrations that sought to lay waste to or seize it. Thus, an unending cycle of creation and repair unfurled within the confines of their extraordinary workshop.

## The Pantheon

To aid them in their divine task, they birthed a pantheon of [[True Gods]]:

- **[[He Who Was]]**
- **[[Avandra, Goddess of Change and Luck - The Changebringer (CG)|Avandra]]**

## The Great Battle: The Red End approaches

In the aeons of antiquity, as the tumultuous [[The Far Realm|Far Realms]] churned in their maddening dance, [[Aena, goddess of kindness, creation and order - The Architect (LG)|Aena]] and [[Kryela, goddess of malice, destruction and chaos - The Undoing (LE)|Kryela]], [[Over-Deities|the cosmic dreamers]], embarked upon a great cyclical battle. Their purpose: to safeguard the sanctity of [[the Eternal Workshop]] from the ceaseless onslaught of the Abominations born of [[the Far Realm]]'s madness.

These battles were cosmic tempests, reverberating through the very fabric of existence. The boundaries of reality trembled as the clash between divine creativity and eldritch chaos unfolded.

## The Red End

In one such cataclysmic confrontation, the heavens wept crimson, and the stars themselves quivered in fear. [[Vordo]] and [[Ethedok]], two of the divine children, bravely stood against the encroaching terror. But the Abomination known as "The Red End" emerged from the depths of madness, a voracious maw of unfathomable hunger.

In a heart-wrenching moment, the cosmic scales tipped toward oblivion, and [[Vordo]] and [[Ethedok]] were devoured by the insatiable maw of The Red End. Their sacrifice echoed across the realms, a testament to the perilous nature of their divine duty.

## Sealing The Red End

[[The Eternal Workshop]] stood on the precipice of annihilation, and [[Aena, goddess of kindness, creation and order - The Architect (LG)|Aena]] and [[Kryela, goddess of malice, destruction and chaos - The Undoing (LE)|Kryela]] redoubled their resolve. Using their strength, [[Over-Deities|the twin goddesses]] sealed The Red End away in a moon cast into the madness of the [[The Far Realm|far realms]].

## The Madness Deepens

It was amidst such turmoil that the very essence of creation and destruction, order and chaos, was tested, shaping the destiny of both [[True Gods]] and [[Over-Deities]] in the crucible of [[the Far Realm]]'s relentless madness.

## Tharizdun's Fall

Tharizdun, driven to madness by the relentless onslaught, tried joining forces with the abominations of [[the far realm]], but in time he was bound by [[Aena, goddess of kindness, creation and order - The Architect (LG)|Aena]] and [[Kryela, goddess of malice, destruction and chaos - The Undoing (LE)|Kryela]] deep within the workshop's depths.
