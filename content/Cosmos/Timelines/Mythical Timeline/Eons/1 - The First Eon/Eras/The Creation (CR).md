## Erecting [[The Greater Limit]]

To shield their creation, [[Aena, goddess of kindness, creation and order - The Architect (LG)|Aena]] and [[Kryela, goddess of malice, destruction and chaos - The Undoing (LE)|Kryela]] erected [[The Greater Limit]] around reality, a protective barrier that confined them to indirect influence. The sheer magnitude of their cosmic power was such that direct involvement could risk shattering the delicate balance of [[The Greater Limit]] itself. In an intricate dance between creation and restraint, the cosmic architects chose to work through subtle channels, guiding the shaping of reality without jeopardizing the very barrier meant to protect it. This delicate equilibrium ensured the preservation of their wondrous creation while maintaining the integrity of [[The Greater Limit]] against the overwhelming forces at play. However, their work was not without flaw, some aberrations were able to enter their creation before [[the Greater limit]] was created, sealing them inside.

## The Birth of the Vast Void

Within the workshop's core, a vast void was born, and into it, the [[True Gods]] were sent to continue their crafting. [[Aena, goddess of kindness, creation and order - The Architect (LG)|Aena]] and [[Kryela, goddess of malice, destruction and chaos - The Undoing (LE)|Kryela]] filled the void with untamed primordial forces, infusing it with the raw essence of creation. These wild and potent energies were to serve as the very building blocks with which the [[True Gods]] could shape and craft the tapestry of reality itself.

## World-Shaping with Elemental Energies

The [[True Gods]] used the primordial elemental energies to create worlds above it all, supported by the ether and the elements. They forged the [[ethereal plane]] and the [[metaphysical planes]], constructing [[Aeloria]], the [[Solis|sun]] and stars, [[The Moon (Aeloria's)|the moon]] and the oceans, and the [[Solar System|planets]] around the [[Solis|sun]]. The [[True Gods]] delved tunnels beneath the earth, filling them with riches, and created magic, writing it as their own to shape the elements through the arcane.

## Realms of Bright and Dark

Some [[True Gods]] favored bright creations more than dark ones, and vice versa, while others loved both equally. To resolve this, they created realms to segregate the creations: the bright [[Feywild]], the dark [[Shadowfell]], and the middle ground called the [[Material Plane|Prime Material]]. These realms mirrored each other, allowing the [[True Gods]] to continue their collaboration while accommodating their diverse preferences, that was the birth of the [[Echo Planes]].

## Creation of Life

With the land still barren, the [[True Gods]] decided to fill it with life. First, they brought forth plants, animals, and trees. Desiring beings with consciousness, they created realms for conscious existence—the [[metapsychic planes]] to hold all thoughts and dreams.

## Emergence of Powerful Beings

The [[True Gods]] crafted powerful beings, starting with the giants - forged by [[Moradin, God of Creation - The Allhammer (LG)|Moradin, The Allhammer]] and the [[True Gods]]- emerged from the mountains, embodying minerals, skies, hills, fire, and ice. The fey, sung into existence by the [[Ainulindalë]], emerged from the very first tree. Selecting some fey, the elves were born, all shaped by the next part of [[Ainulindalë|the song of the gods]], the song crafted by [[Corellon, God of Magic and the Arts - The Spellfather (CG)|Corellon]] and sang by all the [[True Gods]]. The elves migrated to the [[Material Plane|Prime Material]], eager to explore.

After the elves, the dwarves were created by the [[True Gods]], utilizing parts of the giants. Sturdy creatures, the dwarves were forged into existence. Like the elves, they desired exploration, digging out of the mountains to explore the surface.

## Creation of Various Races

Following these events, the [[True Gods]] continued their creative endeavors, bringing forth a multitude of diverse races and creatures to inhabit the vast expanse of [[Aeloria]]. Among these creations were the nimble halflings, the inventive gnomes, the formidable orcs, the enigmatic sphinxes, and the devastating demons, among many others. Each species bore unique characteristics and qualities, contributing to the rich tapestry of life woven by the divine hands.
As the [[True Gods]] reveled in the diversity of their creations, they created the very last race to be made by the [[True Gods]]. Humans, crafted with a blend of divine inspiration and intricate design, humans were endowed with the capacity for great adaptability and resilience.

## The Fragility of Mortal Life

However, their creations lived short lives, as the untamed primordial forces wreaked havoc upon the world. The mortal beings, bestowed with consciousness and free will, faced the relentless onslaught of chaotic energies that threatened the delicate balance of their existence. Each race, from the elves exploring the [[Material Plane|Prime Material]] to the dwarves delving into the depths, grappled with the ephemeral nature of their lives. The [[True Gods]], witnessing the struggles of their cherished creations, contemplated how to mitigate the destructive forces that cast shadows upon the realms they had so meticulously crafted. 

## Growing Discord Among the Deities

While these deities fashioned remarkable wonders, discord kept growing among them, fueled by a growing dissatisfaction with the unfolding course of creation. Some godly beings found themselves at odds with the direction in which the realms were shaping, dissenting voices echoing through the celestial tapestry they had woven. The disagreement stemmed from differing visions of balance, purpose, and the very essence of existence. The clash of perspectives manifested as a cosmic tension, threatening to disrupt the harmonious collaboration that had birthed the myriad wonders of [[Aeloria]]. As the [[True Gods]] grappled with diverging ideals, the fate of their creation hung in the balance, teetering on the precipice of creative brilliance or impending discord.
