## Erecting [[The Greater Limit]]

To shield their creation, [[Aena, goddess of kindness, creation and order - The Architect (LG)|Aena]] and [[Kryela, goddess of malice, destruction and chaos - The Undoing (LE)|Kryela]] erected [[The Greater Limit]] around reality, a protective barrier that confined them to indirect influence. The sheer magnitude of their cosmic power was such that direct involvement could risk shattering the delicate balance of [[The Greater Limit]] itself. In an intricate dance between creation and restraint, the cosmic architects chose to work through subtle channels, guiding the shaping of reality without jeopardizing the very barrier meant to protect it. This delicate equilibrium ensured the preservation of their wondrous creation while maintaining the integrity of [[The Greater Limit]] against the overwhelming forces at play. However, their work was not without flaw, some aberrations were able to enter their creation before [[the Greater limit]] was created, sealing them inside.

## The Birth of the Vast Void

Within the workshop's core, a vast void was born, and into it, the [[True Gods]] were sent to continue their crafting. [[Aena, goddess of kindness, creation and order - The Architect (LG)|Aena]] and [[Kryela, goddess of malice, destruction and chaos - The Undoing (LE)|Kryela]] filled the void with untamed primordial forces, infusing it with the raw essence of creation. These wild and potent energies were to serve as the very building blocks with which the [[True Gods]] could shape and craft the tapestry of reality itself.

## World-Shaping with Elemental Energies

The [[True Gods]] used the primordial elemental energies to create worlds above it all, supported by the ether and the elements. They forged the [[ethereal plane]] and the [[metaphysical planes]], constructing [[Aeloria]], the [[Solis|sun]] and stars, [[The Moon (Aeloria's)|the moon]] and the oceans, and the [[Solar System|planets]] around the [[Solis|sun]]. The [[True Gods]] delved tunnels beneath the earth, filling them with riches, and created magic, writing it as their own to shape the elements through the arcane.

## Realms of Bright and Dark

Some [[True Gods]] favored bright creations more than dark ones, and vice versa, while others loved both equally. To resolve this, they created realms to segregate the creations: the bright [[Feywild]], the dark [[Shadowfell]], and the middle ground called the [[Material Plane|Prime Material]]. These realms mirrored each other, allowing the [[True Gods]] to continue their collaboration while accommodating their diverse preferences, that was the birth of the [[Echo Planes]].

## Creation of Life

With the land still barren, the [[True Gods]] decided to fill it with life. First, Melora, the goddess of nature, created the very first tree, and from it, all animals and plants emerged, designed by the capricious Wildmother. 
Desiring beings with consciousness, the [[True Gods]] created realms for conscious existence—the [[metapsychic planes]] to hold all thoughts and dreams.

## Emergence of Powerful Beings

The [[True Gods]] first crafted powerful beings. These beings were the first mortals with consciousness and free will, capable of shaping the world around them, They emerged from the primordial energies, embodying the essence of the elements and the realms they inhabited. Among these creations were the giants, the fey, the elves and the dwarves, each being shaped by the divine hands of the [[True Gods]].

### The Giants

The giants were forged by Moradin, the god of creation. The [[True Gods|True god]] gathered the oldest rocks and the primordial energies, shaping them into the living beings. The giants emerged within the mountains, embodying minerals, skies, hills, fire, and ice. They were the first to explore the world, delving into the mountains and the skies, seeking to understand the realms they inhabited.

### The Fey and the Elves

The fey, sung into existence by the [[Ainulindalë]], emerged from the very first tree. Selecting some fey, the elves were born, all shaped by [[Ainulindalë|the song of the gods]], composed by [[Corellon, God of Magic and the Arts - The Spellfather (CG)|Corellon]]. The elves migrated to the [[Material Plane|Prime Material]], eager to explore.

### The Dwarves

After the elves, the dwarves were created by the [[True Gods]], utilizing parts of the giants. Sturdy creatures, the dwarves were forged into existence. Like the elves, they desired exploration, digging out of the mountains to explore the surface.

## Creation of Various Races

Following these events, the [[True Gods]] continued their creative endeavors, bringing forth a multitude of diverse races and creatures to inhabit the vast expanse of [[Aeloria]]. 
Among these creations were the nimble halflings, the inventive gnomes, the formidable orcs, the enigmatic sphinxes, and the devastating demons, among many others. Each species bore unique characteristics and qualities, contributing to the rich tapestry of life woven by the divine hands.

### The Creation of Halflings

While exploring the world, [[Avandra, Goddess of Change and Luck - The Changebringer (CG)| Avandra, The Changebringer]] rolled on the hills of the world, and from her laughter, the halflings were born. These nimble creatures were blessed with luck and adaptability, thriving in the ever-changing world around them while searching for peace and comfort.

### The Creation of Orcs

During the era of creation, [[Gruumsh, God of Destruction - The Ruiner (CE)| Gruumsh, the Ruiner]] tried to claim the mountains for himself, but they had already been claimed and the dwarves and giants were already there. [[Gruumsh, God of Destruction - The Ruiner (CE)|Gruumsh]] tried then to claim the forests, but the elves were already there. Each time he tried to claim a place, he was met with resistance. As the other gods laughed at Grummsh's failures, and he responded with anger, the god clasped his mighty spear and burned the forests, the mountains, and the rivers. And from the blood of the earth and the hatred of [[Gruumsh, God of Destruction - The Ruiner (CE)|Gruumsh]], the orcs were born to pillage and destroy.

### The Creation of Humans

As the [[True Gods]] reveled in the diversity of their creations, they created the very last race to be made by the [[True Gods]]. Humans, crafted with a blend of divine inspiration and intricate design, humans were endowed with the capacity for great adaptability and resilience. Although the god that created them is unknown, lost to time, humans quickly spread across the realms, embracing the challenges and opportunities that awaited them.

## The Fragility of Mortal Life

However, their creations lived short lives, as the untamed primordial forces wreaked havoc upon the world. The mortal beings, bestowed with consciousness and free will, faced the relentless onslaught of chaotic energies that threatened the delicate balance of their existence. Each race, from the elves exploring the [[Material Plane|Prime Material]] to the dwarves delving into the depths, grappled with the ephemeral nature of their lives. The [[True Gods]], witnessing the struggles of their cherished creations, contemplated how to mitigate the destructive forces that cast shadows upon the realms they had so meticulously crafted. 

## Growing Discord Among the Deities

While these deities fashioned remarkable wonders, discord kept growing among them, fueled by a growing dissatisfaction with the unfolding course of creation. Some godly beings found themselves at odds with the direction in which the realms were shaping, dissenting voices echoing through the celestial tapestry they had woven. The disagreement stemmed from differing visions of balance, purpose, and the very essence of existence. The clash of perspectives manifested as a cosmic tension, threatening to disrupt the harmonious collaboration that had birthed the myriad wonders of [[Aeloria]]. As the [[True Gods]] grappled with diverging ideals, the fate of their creation hung in the balance, teetering on the precipice of creative brilliance or impending discord.
