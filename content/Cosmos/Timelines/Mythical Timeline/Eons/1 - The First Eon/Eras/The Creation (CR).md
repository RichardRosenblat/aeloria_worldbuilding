## Erecting [[The Greater Limit]]

To shield their creation from the influence of the [[The Far Realm|Far Realm]], [[Aena, goddess of kindness, creation and order - The Architect (LG)|Aena]] and [[Kryela, goddess of malice, destruction and chaos - The Undoing (CE)|Kryela]] erected [[The Greater Limit]] at the core of the [[The Eternal Workshop]], a protective barrier that sealed the center of the [[The Eternal Workshop]] and the prisons of [[Tharizdun, God of Madness - The Chained Oblivion (CE)|Tharizdun]] from the madness of the [[The Far Realm]], but also confined the [[Over-Deities|Cosmic Dreamers]] to indirect influence. The sheer magnitude of their cosmic power was such that direct involvement could risk shattering the delicate balance of [[The Greater Limit]] itself. In an intricate dance between creation and restraint, the cosmic architects chose to work through subtle channels, guiding the shaping of reality without jeopardizing the very barrier meant to protect it. This delicate equilibrium ensured the preservation of their wondrous creation while maintaining the integrity of [[The Greater Limit]] against the overwhelming forces at play. However, their work was not without flaw, some aberrations were able to enter their creation before [[the Greater limit]] was created, sealing them inside.

## The Birth of the Vast Void

Within the [[The Greater Limit]], a vast void was created, and into it, the [[True Gods]] were sent to continue their crafting. [[Aena, goddess of kindness, creation and order - The Architect (LG)|Aena]] and [[Kryela, goddess of malice, destruction and chaos - The Undoing (CE)|Kryela]] filled the void with untamed primordial forces, infusing it with the raw essence of creation. These wild and potent energies were to serve as the very building blocks with which the [[True Gods]] could shape and craft the tapestry of reality itself.

## World-Shaping with Elemental Energies

The [[True Gods]] used the primordial elemental energies to create worlds above it all, supported by the ether and the elements. They forged the [[ethereal plane]] and the [[metaphysical planes]], using the elemental energies to shape the very fabric of reality. The [[True Gods]] started their work and divine collaboration.

## The Creation of [[Aeloria]] Itself

## Realms of Bright and Dark

Some [[True Gods]] favored bright creations more than dark ones, and vice versa, while others loved both equally. To resolve this, they created realms to segregate the creations: the bright [[Feywild]], the dark [[Shadowfell]], and the middle ground called the [[Material Plane|Prime Material]]. These realms mirrored each other, allowing the [[True Gods]] to continue their collaboration while accommodating their diverse preferences, that was the birth of the [[Echo Planes]].

## Creation of [[Pyrosphere]]

## The First Spell

## Creation of Life

With the land still barren, the [[True Gods]] decided to fill it with life. First, [[Melora, Goddess of the Wild and Sea - The Wildmother (N)|Melora]], the goddess of nature, created the very first tree, and from it, all animals and plants emerged, designed by the capricious Wildmother. 

## The Creation of Many Creatures and [[Mossloch]]

![[Mossloch#Creation]]

## The Desire for Consiousness

Desiring beings with consciousness, the [[True Gods]] created realms for conscious existence—the [[metapsychic planes]] to hold all thoughts and dreams.

## Emergence of Powerful Beings

The [[True Gods]] first crafted powerful beings. These beings were the first mortals with consciousness and free will, capable of shaping the world around them, They emerged from the primordial energies, embodying the essence of the elements and the realms they inhabited. Among these creations were the giants, the fey, the elves and the dwarves, each being shaped by the divine hands of the [[True Gods]].

### The Giants

The giants were forged by [[Kord, God of Strength and Storms - The Stormlord (CN)|Kord]] and [[Moradin, God of Creation, Forgecraft and Legacy - The Allhammer (LG)|Moradin]]. [[Moradin, God of Creation, Forgecraft and Legacy - The Allhammer (LG)|Moradin]] had created the first and biggest mountain, and [[Kord, God of Strength and Storms - The Stormlord (CN)|Kord]] impressed by the creation, decided to climb to the very top of the mountain to see the world from above. As he strode unstoppable as a unyielding storm, he reached out his hand and grabbed the pure elemental forces of the world, dragging them with him to the top of the mountain. During his climb, the elemental forces joined with parts of the mountain, the hills from below, the stones from the mountain, the ice from the top, the fire from the magma, the clouds from the sky, and when he reached the top, he shaped created a mighty storm to lift himself above the mountain, imbuing the storm with the elemental forces he had gathered as a final gift to the world. And thus the first giants were born, each embodying the elements of the world. 

### The Fey and the Elves

The fey, sung into existence by the [[Ainulindalë]], emerged from the very first tree. Selecting some fey, the elves were born, all shaped by [[Ainulindalë|the song of the gods]], composed by [[Corellon, God of Magic, Spring, Creativity and the Arts - The Spellfather (CG)|Corellon]]. [[Corellon, God of Magic, Spring, Creativity and the Arts - The Spellfather (CG)|Corellon]] created the Eladrin, the Sun Elves and the Moon Elves, each with unique characteristics and abilities inspired in the leaves, the branches, and the roots of the first tree. The Sun and Moon Elves migrated to the [[Material Plane|Prime Material]], eager to explore. As time took it's course, the Eladrin remained in the [[Feywild]], unchanged by the passage of time as the plane itself was. The Moon Elves became the drows, and the Sun Elves became the other elven subspecies, such as the wood elves and the high elves.

### The Dwarves

After the elves, the dwarves were created by the [[Moradin, God of Creation, Forgecraft and Legacy - The Allhammer (LG)|The Allhammer]], utilizing parts of the giants. Sturdy creatures, the dwarves were forged into existence. Like the elves, they desired exploration, digging out of the mountains to explore the surface.

## Creation of Various Species

Following these events, the [[True Gods]] continued their creative endeavors, bringing forth a multitude of diverse species and creatures to inhabit the vast expanse of [[Aeloria]]. 
Among these creations were the nimble halflings, the inventive gnomes, the formidable orcs, the enigmatic sphinxes, and the powerful archfey, among many others. Each species bore unique characteristics and qualities, contributing to the rich tapestry of life woven by the divine hands.
The order of creation after the creation of the dwarves often varies depending on the source, but it is known that the last humanoid species created from the [[True Gods]] were the tallmen. The humanoid species that came after them were created by either artificial means or altering existing species.

### The Creation of The Archfey and The [[Fey Sisters]]

![[Fey Sisters#Creation]]

### The Creation of The Satyr

During the years of creation, all the gods would often gather to celebrate their creations, during one of these grand celebrations, the night sky was illuminated by a thousand stars, and a great bonfire roared in the center of a divine gathering. The air was filled with laughter and joy as the gods feasted and reveled in the splendor of their creation. Among the gods were [[Melora, Goddess of the Wild and Sea - The Wildmother (N)|Melora, the Wildmother]], and [[Corellon, God of Magic, Spring, Creativity and the Arts - The Spellfather (CG)|, Corellon, The Spellfather]], both renowned for their love of nature and artistry. As the night wore on, the festivities grew even more exuberant. The gods danced and sang, their spirits lifted by the beauty of the night and their creations. Yet, amidst the celebration, [[Melora, Goddess of the Wild and Sea - The Wildmother (N)|Melora]] and [[Corellon, God of Magic, Spring, Creativity and the Arts - The Spellfather (CG)|Corellon]] felt that something was missing. The music, though divine, lacked the wild, untamed spirit that they both cherished.

"[[Corellon, God of Magic, Spring, Creativity and the Arts - The Spellfather (CG)|Corellon]]," said [[Melora, Goddess of the Wild and Sea - The Wildmother (N)|Melora]], her cheeks flushed with the warmth of wine and the glow of the bonfire, "We need beings that can embody the essence of the wild and the joy of creation. Beings that can dance and sing with the freedom of the wind and the beauty of the stars. What say you?"

[[Corellon, God of Magic, Spring, Creativity and the Arts - The Spellfather (CG)|Corellon]], equally inspired and slightly tipsy, smiled and nodded. "You speak true, [[Melora, Goddess of the Wild and Sea - The Wildmother (N)|Melora]]. Let us create beings unlike any other, beings  naturally gifted in dance and song that can bring the untamed spirit of the wild, to our celebrations and inspire us with their artistry."

With a shared glance of mischief and creativity, and a few more sips of wine, mead, ale and beer. The two gods set to work. [[Corellon, God of Magic, Spring, Creativity and the Arts - The Spellfather (CG)|Corellon]] gathered the finest colors from the [[Feywild]] and his tools made and [[Melora, Goddess of the Wild and Sea - The Wildmother (N)|Melora]] plucked the goats she created that same day, the finest of them all, and brought them round the bonfire. Together, they began to paint the goats. With each stroke, their fur became a canvas of vibrant hues, swirling with the colors of the forest and the [[Feywild]]. The magic of the paints seeped into their very beings, as a final touch, [[Corellon, God of Magic, Spring, Creativity and the Arts - The Spellfather (CG)|Corellon]] and [[Melora, Goddess of the Wild and Sea - The Wildmother (N)|Melora]] brought the very first tree next to the bonfire, and from it, they plucked the finest leaves and branches, and adorned the goats with them, the leaves and branches grew into their fur, and their horns became adorned with flowers and vines. As the magic of the tree seeped into their very beings, the goats began to change. And when the transformation completed, the once ordinary goats stood before the gods as new creatures —satyrs, with the lower bodies of goats and the upper bodies of playful, fey beings. They had horns adorned with flowers and vines, and their eyes sparkled with the mischievous light of freedom.

Immediately, the satyrs picked up instruments crafted from nature itself—flutes made from reeds, drums from hollowed logs, and lyres strung with the finest vines. They began to play, their music wild and enchanting, filling the air with melodies that resonated with the heartbeat of the earth and the laughter of the wind. The gods were entranced. They danced and sang along with the satyrs, the celebration reaching new heights of joy and merriment. The satyrs' music was a gift to the gods, a testament to the spontaneous creativity and love of life that [[Melora, Goddess of the Wild and Sea - The Wildmother (N)|Melora]] and [[Corellon, God of Magic, Spring, Creativity and the Arts - The Spellfather (CG)|Corellon]] embodied.

"Well done, my friends," said [[Corellon, God of Magic, Spring, Creativity and the Arts - The Spellfather (CG)|Corellon]], his eyes shining with delight. "You shall be known as the satyrs, the bringers of music and dance, the guardians of revelry and joy." [[Melora, Goddess of the Wild and Sea - The Wildmother (N)|Melora]] nodded in agreement, her smile radiant in the firelight. "May your music echo through the forests and meadows, bringing laughter and celebration wherever you go. For your celebration is a reflection of the divine joy that brought you into being." The satyrs embraced their role with delight. 

After the festivities, the satyrs roamed the forests and meadows of the [[Feywild]], their music echoing through the trees and the rivers. They danced under the twilight sky, their laughter mingling with the rustle of leaves and the whisper of the wind. And wherever they went, they brought joy and merriment, their music a testament to the wild, untamed spirit of creation that flowed through their veins. 

### The Creation of Drows
Years after the creation of the elves, the Moon elves, who had migrated to the [[Material Plane|Prime Material]] alongside the Sun Elves, had restricted themselves to the dark caves, away from the [[Solis|sun]]. Different from their Sun Elf cousins, the Moon Elves were couldn't stand the [[Solis|sun]]'s light for long, so they had to move and explore the darkness of the [[Underdark]]. 
This caused the Sun Elves to become distant from their Moon Elf cousins, and the Moon Elves to become resentful of their Sun Elf cousins. [[Lolth, Goddess of Spiders and Lies - The Spider Queen (LE)|Lolth, The Spider Queen]], who had been watching the elves from the shadows and ever cunning, saw that such resentment could be honed into hatred and be used with grace and power. 

So the [[Lolth, Goddess of Spiders and Lies - The Spider Queen (LE)|spider goddess]] changed her form, to that of a beautiful Moon Elf, but with her hair white, her eyes red and her lower body that of a monstrous spider. And with sweet whispers and promises of power and of a endless night where they could conquer the surface, she convinced the Moon Elves to worship her, and she taught them the ways of deceit, treachery, and power as she invited them to go further into the [[Underdark|Middledark and Lowerdark]]. The Moon Elves, went through a intense and painful transformation as they enacted depraved rituals in the name of [[Lolth, Goddess of Spiders and Lies - The Spider Queen (LE)|Lolth]], their skin went from a pale blue to a dark purple with the dark power of [[Lolth, Goddess of Spiders and Lies - The Spider Queen (LE)|The Spider Queen]], and their hair turned white with the sheer stress of the excruciating rituals, as they were blessed with the power of the [[Lolth, Goddess of Spiders and Lies - The Spider Queen (LE)|spider goddess]] they became the Drows.

After each ritual, more and more Sun Elves would be experimented on and ultimately sacrificed to [[Lolth, Goddess of Spiders and Lies - The Spider Queen (LE)|Lolth]]. [[Corellon, God of Magic, Spring, Creativity and the Arts - The Spellfather (CG)|Corellon]], the god of the elves, was horrified by the transformation and rituals of his children, and he declared the Moon Elves who had become Drows as traitors by cursing them to never step under the sun's light again and promised that he would get his revenge on [[Lolth, Goddess of Spiders and Lies - The Spider Queen (LE)|The Spider Queen]] and her followers. 

### The Creation of Halflings

While exploring the world, [[Avandra, Goddess of Change, Autumn and Luck - The Changebringer (CG)| Avandra, The Changebringer]] rolled on the hills of the world, and from her laughter, the halflings were born. These nimble creatures were blessed with luck and adaptability, thriving in the ever-changing world around them while searching for peace and comfort.

### The Creation of Goblinoids

[[Bane, God of War and Conquest - The Strife Emperor (LE)|Bane, The Strife Emperor]] was displeased with the how the world was turning out, he saw the world's potential, it's strenght and raw power were raw and untamed as raging oportunities to be seized. So [[Bane, God of War and Conquest - The Strife Emperor (LE)|Bane]] walked through all of [[Aeloria]] searching for the perfect creatures to be his soldiers to start his conquest, but to his displeasure, he found none, no being seemed to be able to match his expectations. So he kept searching and from his shadow created by the sun, the goblinoids were born to be the perfect soldiers. They were at first reflections of [[Bane, God of War and Conquest - The Strife Emperor (LE)|Bane]]'s own nature, bloodshot eyes, dark armored skin, and a thirst for power. They followed [[Bane, God of War and Conquest - The Strife Emperor (LE)|Bane]] with loyalty, and he taught them the ways of war and conquest. But just like their creator, they were also cunning and deceitful, and they soon began to plot against their master, seeking to claim the power of [[Bane, God of War and Conquest - The Strife Emperor (LE)|the strife emperor]] for themselves. But [[Bane, God of War and Conquest - The Strife Emperor (LE)|Bane]] was always one step ahead, before they could strike, he seized their souls with his iron fist, and flaid their intelect and will, their bodies became twisted like their minds, and they were cast into the world as the goblinoids we know today. As a final reminder of their betrayal, [[Bane, God of War and Conquest - The Strife Emperor (LE)|Bane]] cursed them to never be able to claim the power they so desired, and to always fight among themselves, never able to unite under a single banner for long. Such curse became known as the curse of strife.

### The Creation of Orcs

During the era of creation, [[Gruumsh, God of Destruction - The Ruiner (CE)| Gruumsh, the Ruiner]] tried to claim the mountains for himself, but they had already been claimed and the dwarves and giants were already there. [[Gruumsh, God of Destruction - The Ruiner (CE)|Gruumsh]] tried then to claim the forests, but the elves were already there. Each time he tried to claim a place, he was met with resistance. As the other gods laughed at Grummsh's failures, and he responded with anger, the god clasped his mighty spear and burned the forests, the mountains, and the rivers. And from the blood of the earth and the hatred of [[Gruumsh, God of Destruction - The Ruiner (CE)|Gruumsh]], the orcs were born to pillage and destroy.

### The Creation of The Firbolgs

After the creation of the Orcs, [[Melora, Goddess of the Wild and Sea - The Wildmother (N)|Melora, the goddess of nature]], saw that the world had been damaged by the creations of the other gods, not only the orcs but the goblinoids, the giants, and the dwarves had all hollowed mountains, hunted creatures without the need to eat, and destroyed the forests without spreading the seeds. So she decided to make a spacies that could heal the world and keep it in balance. She searched for the perfect creature to become her guardians of the wild, she sat on rock ledges, walked through sunken lanes, and swam through the rivers, turned every stone and grain of sand, and it was then that she understood, while floating in the ocean looking towards the starry night sky adorned by [[Sehanine, Goddess of the Moon, Dreams and Tricks - The Moonweaver (CG)|Sehanine]]'s moon, that she could never find the perfect creature for no creature could represent the entire of the wild. "Why do you ponder so heavily on this, sister?" asked [[Sehanine, Goddess of the Moon, Dreams and Tricks - The Moonweaver (CG)|Sehanine]], the moon goddess, standing on the water's surface creating small ripples. "I seek a creature that can represent the wild in its entirety, but I can't find it, for the wild is too vast and diverse to be represented by a single creature." [[Melora, Goddess of the Wild and Sea - The Wildmother (N)|Melora]] replied. "Then, why not make a creature that can understand, adapt, and grow with the wild? Much alike my [[The Moon (Aeloria's)|moon]] that constantly changes, waxes and wanes, and moves through the night sky." [[Sehanine, Goddess of the Moon, Dreams and Tricks - The Moonweaver (CG)|Sehanine]] suggested. [[Melora, Goddess of the Wild and Sea - The Wildmother (N)|Melora]], inspired by her sister's words, gathered moss of the very first mountain and created the firbolgs enlisting [[Sehanine, Goddess of the Moon, Dreams and Tricks - The Moonweaver (CG)|Sehanine]]'s help to give them the ability to adapt and change with the wild, and to understand the wild in its entirety. The firbolgs were born, and they became the guardians of the wild, they were the protectors of the forests, the mountains, the rivers, and the oceans, they were the healers of the world, and they were the children of the wild. 

### The Creation of Kenku

The kenku were created by [[Ioun, Goddess of Knowledge - The Enlightened (N)|Ioun, The Enlightened]] to help her manage the vast amount of knowledge she had gathered in tomes, books and scrolls. The kenku were created to be loyal and hardworking, their job was simple but important, managing so much content was a task that required a lot of attention to detail, and the kenku were perfect for the job. Too much knowlege mixed with creativity and free will could be dangerous for the world and themselves, so to not stripe the kenku of their free will and make them unnable to truly appreciate the world around them, [[Ioun, Goddess of Knowledge - The Enlightened (N)|Ioun]] made them unable to create new things, they could only replicate what they had seen or heard. After the creation of [[Ioun's Archive]], all the kenku that took the arduous job to mantaining the vast library of [[Ioun, Goddess of Knowledge - The Enlightened (N)|The Goddess of Knowledge]] were given access to a scroll called [[The Wings' Epistle]] that contained texts in a language that could only be written by the goddess herself, such scroll had the power to give beautiful wings to any creature who read it.

### The Creation of Sphinxes

After [[Ioun, Goddess of Knowledge - The Enlightened (N)|Ioun]] created the Kenku, she realized all the knowledge she posessed and the power it had was dangerous, so she decided to create beings that are able to protect the knowledge she had gathered. She created the sphinxes, beings of great power and wisdom, they were tasked with protecting the knowledge of the world, and to only share it with those who were worthy of it. The sphinxes were created with the body of a lion, the wings of an eagle, and the head of a tallman, they were the perfect combination of strength, wisdom, and power. The sphinxes were placed in all of the locations where she kept her knowledge, and once it was build, the sphinx were placed on the entrance of [[Ioun's Archive]] to protect the vast knowledge of the goddess.

### The Creation of The Leonin

While [[Pelor, God of the Sun, Summer and Agriculture - The Dawnfather (NG)|Pelor]] crossed the skies of [[Aeloria]], he looked upon the land, across golden plains and grassy fields, and saw the creatures that roamed the world, growing and thriving under the light of the sun. But he also saw the dangers that lurked in the shadows, from monstrous beasts to treacherous environments. He saw the need for protectors and guardians of the land, beings that would stand strong against the darkness and defend the light. So he decided to create a species that would embody the virtues of courage, strength, pride and loyalty. [[Pelor, God of the Sun, Summer and Agriculture - The Dawnfather (NG)|Pelor]] gathered the golden sands of the deserts, imbued with the might of his light, and the pride he found on the lions that roamed the lands, and with his divine power, he shaped them into the form of the leonin, a powerful and proud species, made to protect the weak and be ever vigilant against evil. 

### The Creation of The Triton

While walking through the currents of the oceans, [[Melora, Goddess of the Wild and Sea - The Wildmother (N)|Melora, goddess of the seas and the wild]] looked above and saw the vastness of the oceans and when she looked below, she saw the dangers that lurked within, from monstrous creatures to treacherous environments. She saw the need for guardianship and exploration of the underwater realms, so she decided to create a species that will be able to traverse the depths and safeguard the balance of the underwater realms she had created. She gathered materials of all of the Veilshroud Seas, representing the diverse challenges and environments her new creation will face. From the Serpent’s Maw Ocean, she gathered the teeth of krakens and the scales of leviathans, imbued with the ability to withstand and combat monstrous threats. From the Icebound Sea, she gathered the frost of the icebergs and the snow that pierced the surface, imbued with the ability to endure and thrive in the most unforgiving conditions and enviroments. From the Breathless Ocean she gathered the crystals that formed in the still waters and the coral that grew in the depths of the kelp forests, imbued with the wisdom to navigate the waters and the patience to overcome obstacles with careful deliberation. And finally, from the Evergale Sea, she gathered the winds that roared through the storms and the waves that crashed against the cliffs, imbued with the bravery and courage to face their challenges head on. With all the materials gathered, she combined them with her divine power, shaping them into the form of the triton, a species of aquatic beings with the inherent traits necessary to fulfill their role as guardians and explorers of the seas. The triton emerged from their creation with a deep-rooted connection to the seas and a sacred duty to preserve its delicate balance, ensuring that their existence is intertwined with the fate of the underwater realms they call home.

### The Creation of Gnomes

The [[Ioun, Goddess of Knowledge - The Enlightened (N)|Goddess of Knowledge, Ioun]] was constantly writing her knowlegde of the world, and she wrote the laws that rule over reality and the many secrets of reality, but the goddess wished to write stories, she thirsted for tales, myths and adventures to be written in her vast collection of books, but the beings that already existed in [[Aeloria]] were not enough to satisfy her thirst for stories, they weren't curious enough, or not enough of them existed to create the stories she wished to write. While that, [[Erathis, Goddess of Civilization and Invention - The Lawbearer (LN)| Goddess of Invention, Erathis]], was exploring the world, and watching over the creatures that lived in it. But these creatures were content with their lot in life, they didn't seek to explore or create, she desired to see them use the materials around them to create new wonders, to explore and enjoy every second of the world, she dreamed of beings filled with curiosity and creativity. So the two goddesses joined forces, they used their knowledge and creativity to invent a infinitely complex and intricate machine, that could create beings curious and inventive, the gnomes. As the goddesses activated the machine, it's cogs spun quickly and it took the materials from the depths of the world, the forests and the rocks around it, and from the machine, the gnomes emerged, ever curious and inventive, they explored the world, creating stories, tales and machines.

### The Creation of The Tabaxi

During her travels, [[Melora, Goddess of the Wild and Sea - The Wildmother (N)|Melora, the goddess of nature]], saw the world she had created and the creatures that inhabited it. She saw the elves exploring the forests, the dwarves delving into the mountains, and the gnomes inventing new wonders. But she also saw the other creatures that roamed the world, the orcs pillaging the land, the goblinoids fighting among themselves, and the tallmen struggling to survive. She grew worried, the [[Melora, Goddess of the Wild and Sea - The Wildmother (N)|the Wildmother]] then became a vulture and flew over the world, she saw the dark clouds looming on the horizon, threatening chaos and despair. She looked into the edge of the horizon and saw the coming maelstrom and the true destruction of the world. 
Her heart filled with unease, [[Melora, Goddess of the Wild and Sea - The Wildmother (N)|Melora]] decided to take action to protect her domain. She drew upon the elements and took inspiration on her previous creations that roamed the wilderness, she created the Tabaxi, cat-like humanoids imbued with curiosity, to learn more about the looming darkness, with agility, to be able to escape the dangers that would come, and with cunning, to be able to outsmart anything that stood on the way of them protecting creation. [[Melora, Goddess of the Wild and Sea - The Wildmother (N) |The Wildmother]] entrusted them with a sacred quest: to explore the world, learn its secrets, and prepare for the coming storm, so that when the time came, they would be ready to face the darkness, to outwit the luring shadows, and to protect the world from the impending doom. The tabaxi embraced their mission with fervor, setting out to explore the world and uncover its mysteries, ready to face any challenges that lay ahead. During their travels, the Tabaxi encountered wonders beyond description, and horrors beyond imagination, they did whatever they could to collect artifacts, knowledge, tales and lore. They learned from the land, the wind, and the sea, growing stronger and wiser with each passing day. But despite their efforts, the tabaxi were marginalized and misunderstood by other humanoid species, being considered little less than thieves and rogues, they are often cast out by simply being themselves and following their mission. But the tabaxi accepted their underdog status and recognized the importance of their mission, they resolved to rise above their circumstances and prove their worth. Many fight directly against their oppressors, others see it as unnecessary and simply focus on their mission, but all of them are united by their shared purpose: to protect the world from the darkness that looms on the horizon. All tabaxis know that they are more than cunning thieves or outcasts, they are guardians of ancient wisdom and champions of opportunity. They walk their perilous journey with heads held high, ready to face any challenges that come their way.

### The Creation of Lizardfolk

Zehir, the cloaked serpent, the god of darkness and poison, saw the world and the creatures that inhabited it, he saw the beasts roaming aimlessly and the humanoids suffering for trivial emotions, he undertood them to be weak, those beings were not able to survive the world he saw and thus failures, they were either plagued with uneficient emotions or incapable of aiming for true greatness. So he decided to create his own kind of creature, he lurked in the forests and gathered the most promissing creatures made by [[Melora, Goddess of the Wild and Sea - The Wildmother (N)|Melora]], the goddess of nature, to the eyes of the cloaked serpent, the cold-blooded creatures, lizards, snakes and other reptiles were the ones that pleased him the most, although they lacked sentience, they could lurk in the shadows, strike with poison and precision and survive the harshest of environments. So he created a powerful concoction of venom, darkness and cold-blooded creatures, and from it, the lizardfolk were born, unbothered by emotions and capable of surviving the harshest of environments, they would be the perfect creatures to survive the world he saw. But the lizardfolk were not as Zehir expected, they lacked the desire for power and greatness, they were content with their lot in life and saw no need on planing more than the next hunt. Zehir was displeased, he cursed the lizardfolk to never be able to rise above their current state, to never be able to aim for greatness, and to always be content with their lot in life. The lizardfolk accepted their curse and embraced their nature, they saw no need for power or greatness, they were content with what they were, and they would survive the world as they were, they would be the perfect creatures to survive the world Zehir saw.

### [[Sehanine, Goddess of the Moon, Dreams and Tricks - The Moonweaver (CG)|Sehanine]] creating the Plasmoids

During the creation of the world, after [[Sehanine, Goddess of the Moon, Dreams and Tricks - The Moonweaver (CG)|Sehanine]] crafted the moon, she gazed upon the land and its inhabitants. She desired creatures capable of adapting and evolving, embodying the fluidity and changeability of the moon itself. She gathered moonlight in her hands, combined it with the first dew of each season, and infused it with her laughter. From this blend, she created the plasmoids, beings without fixed forms, able to shift their shapes and colors at will, as varied as moonlight. Upon finishing her creation, [[Sehanine, Goddess of the Moon, Dreams and Tricks - The Moonweaver (CG)|Sehanine]] entrusted the plasmoids with a mission: to explore every corner of the world, seeking beauty and wonder in all things. She encouraged them to adapt and change to understand the reality around them, form beautiful relationships, and forge deep connections. She urged them to embrace their emotions and dreams, for they were children of the moon. Thus, the plasmoids embarked on their journey, exploring the world in every direction, always reaching high and dreaming even higher, fulfilling their purpose.

### The Creation of Tallmen

As the [[True Gods]] reveled in the diversity of their creations, they created the very last humanoid species to be made by the [[True Gods]]. Tallmen, crafted with a blend of divine inspiration and intricate design, tallmen were endowed with the capacity for great adaptability and resilience. Although the god that created them is unknown, lost to time, tallmen quickly spread across the realms, embracing the challenges and opportunities that awaited them. And so, the tallmen became the most numerous and diverse of all the humanoid species, their presence shaping the course of history and the unfolding tapestry of [[Aeloria]]. Any humanoid species that came after the tallmen were created by artificial means or altering existing species.

## The Fragility of Mortal Life

However, their creations lived short lives, as the untamed primordial forces wreaked havoc upon the world. The mortal beings, bestowed with consciousness and free will, faced the relentless onslaught of chaotic energies that threatened the delicate balance of their existence. Each species, from the elves exploring the [[Material Plane|Prime Material]] to the dwarves delving into the depths, grappled with the ephemeral nature of their lives. The [[True Gods]], witnessing the struggles of their cherished creations, contemplated how to mitigate the destructive forces that cast shadows upon the realms they had so meticulously crafted. 

## Growing Discord Among the Deities

While these deities fashioned remarkable wonders, discord kept growing among them, fueled by a growing dissatisfaction with the unfolding course of creation. Some godly beings found themselves at odds with the direction in which the realms were shaping, dissenting voices echoing through the celestial tapestry they had woven. The disagreement stemmed from differing visions of balance, purpose, and the very essence of existence. The clash of perspectives manifested as a cosmic tension, threatening to disrupt the harmonious collaboration that had birthed the myriad wonders of [[Aeloria]]. As the [[True Gods]] grappled with diverging ideals, the fate of their creation hung in the balance, teetering on the precipice of creative brilliance or impending discord.
