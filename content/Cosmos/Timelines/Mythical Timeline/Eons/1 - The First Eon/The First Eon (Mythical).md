In the eon known as "The First Eon" within the [[mythical timeline]] of [[Aeloria]], the foundations of existence were laid by [[Over-Deities|the cosmic dreamers]] [[Aena, goddess of kindness, creation and order - The Architect (LG)|Aena]] and [[Kryela, goddess of malice, destruction and chaos - The Undoing (LE)|Kryela]] in the tumultuous [[The Far Realm|Far Realms]]. Their divine craftsmanship unfolded in the awe-inspiring domain called [[The Eternal Workshop]], where opposing forces of creation and destruction, order and chaos, engaged in a perpetual dance. The birth of a pantheon of [[True Gods]] marked the commencement of a cosmic battle against the aberrations of [[the Far Realm]], culminating in the sacrificial stand against the insatiable "Red End." The sealing of this cosmic terror in a moon showcased the resilience of [[Aena, goddess of kindness, creation and order - The Architect (LG)|Aena]] and [[Kryela, goddess of malice, destruction and chaos - The Undoing (LE)|Kryela]]. Subsequently, the [[The Creation (CR)|Creation Era]] saw the construction of [[The Greater Limit]], shielding reality as the [[True Gods]] shaped the diverse tapestry of [[Aeloria]]. Elemental energies, ethereal and [[metaphysical planes]], and the realms of [[Feywild]], [[Shadowfell]], and [[Material Plane|Prime Material]] came into existence, fostering life and powerful beings. However, mortal fragility and growing discord among the deities hinted at challenges that would test the very fabric of [[Aeloria]]'s existence. As the [[True Gods]] grappled with diverging ideals, the fate of their creation hung in a delicate balance, poised between creative brilliance and impending discord. ^2f765f
