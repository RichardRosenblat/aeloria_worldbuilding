## The Return of Primordial Forces

The resurgence of the primordial forces marked a dark chapter in the [[Aeloria]]'s history, unleashing cataclysms that shook the very foundations of existence. This tumultuous period set the stage for the final and devastating conflict: the War of the [[True Gods]], a catastrophic event forever etched in the records of time as "The Great War."

## Celestial Conflict and World Reshaping

As the forces clashed in the celestial realms, the repercussions reverberated throughout the land, bringing death and upheaval. The very landscape underwent a profound transformation, scarred by the ferocity of the divine struggle.

## The Creation of Divine Armaments

In the crucible of The Great War, as the [[True Gods]] clashed in celestial combat, they forged weapons of unparalleled power to tip the scales in their favor. These divine armaments became legendary relics, each imbued with the essence of their divine creators.

### [[Harmonious Vestiges]]

In their pursuit of balance and preservation, the [[Harmonious Gods]] crafted the **[[Harmonious Vestiges]]**. These artifacts held the essence of harmonious energies, intended to bring stability to the tumultuous world. Those deemed worthy could wield these vestiges to channel the benevolent forces that sought equilibrium.

### [[Defiant Vestiges]]

Conversely, the [[Defiant Gods]], driven by rebellion and the desire for change, forged the **[[Defiant Vestiges]]**. These weapons resonated with chaotic energies, embodying the defiance that fueled their cause. Those daring enough to wield these vestiges gained access to formidable powers capable of challenging the established order.

## Divine Wrath Unleashed

As the [[True Gods]] waged their celestial conflict during The Great War, the very fabric of [[Aeloria]] bore witness to unparalleled devastation. Cities crumbled, civilizations fell, and the once-thriving landscapes were transformed into desolate wastelands.

## Toxic Air and Decimated Reaches

The war's catastrophic consequences extended beyond the battlefield. The air itself became toxic, carrying the residue of divine strife that permeated the atmosphere. Vast reaches of [[Aeloria]] were laid to waste, with fields disintegrating, mountains crumbling, and once-prosperous lands reduced to barren expanses.

## Beings of Great Power

To further their cosmic ambitions, the [[True Gods]] created beings of immense power to serve as instruments of war. These entities, born from the chaotic energies unleashed, stalked the ravaged lands, enforcing the will of their divine creators with devastating force.

## Waters Turned Poison

Even the waters, once a source of life and sustenance, were tainted by the war's malevolent touch. Poison currents coursed through rivers and oceans, posing an additional threat to the surviving remnants of civilizations struggling to endure in the aftermath of the celestial conflict.

However, all concrete information about his origins and prowess was systematically erased as part of his transformation into a god.
