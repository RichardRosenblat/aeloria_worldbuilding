## The Return of Primordial Forces

The resurgence of the primordial forces marked a dark chapter in the [[Aeloria]]'s history, unleashing cataclysms that shook the very foundations of existence. This tumultuous period set the stage for the final and devastating conflict: the War of the [[True Gods]], a catastrophic event forever etched in the records of time as "The Great War."

## Celestial Conflict and World Reshaping

As the forces clashed in the celestial realms, the repercussions reverberated throughout the land, bringing death and upheaval. The very landscape underwent a profound transformation, scarred by the ferocity of the divine struggle.


## The Wound of [[Gruumsh, God of Destruction - The Ruiner (CE)|Gruumsh]]

During the conflict, [[Gruumsh, God of Destruction - The Ruiner (CE)|Gruumsh, The Ruiner]], the god of destruction, suffered a grievous wound from an arrow shot by [[Corellon, God of Magic, Spring, Creativity and the Arts - The Spellfather (CG)|Corellon, the Spellfather]] infused with [[Bahamut, God  of Justice and Nobility - The Platinum Dragon (LG)|Bahamut, The Platinum Dragon]]'s righteous power. This wound would forever mark by the loss of his eye, a symbol of his eternal hatred for the [[Bahamut, God  of Justice and Nobility - The Platinum Dragon (LG)|draconic god]], [[Corellon, God of Magic, Spring, Creativity and the Arts - The Spellfather (CG)|Corellon]], and all those that opposed him. The wound would serve as a reminder of the divine conflict that had torn the world asunder, a testament to the cost of the celestial struggle. [[Gruumsh, God of Destruction - The Ruiner (CE)|Gruumsh]] as a god of vengeance and hatred, fueling his desire for retribution against the other gods, specially against the noble and just of [[Bahamut, God  of Justice and Nobility - The Platinum Dragon (LG)|Bahamut]] and the elfs [[Corellon, God of Magic, Spring, Creativity and the Arts - The Spellfather (CG)|Corellon]].

## Battle Between [[Asmodeus, God of Tyranny - The Lord of the Nine Hells (LE)|Asmodeus]] and [[Avandra, Goddess of Change, Autumn and Luck - The Changebringer (CG)|Avandra]]

[[Asmodeus, God of Tyranny - The Lord of the Nine Hells (LE)|Asmodeus]], hungering for dominion over all living beings, sought to impose his will upon the realms. His ambition knew no bounds, casting shadows of tyranny across the lands. [[Avandra, Goddess of Change, Autumn and Luck - The Changebringer (CG)|Avandra]], saw his designs as a dire threat to the freedom she cherished.

The battlefield of their conflict spanned across the celestial realms, echoing with the clash of divine power. [[Avandra, Goddess of Change, Autumn and Luck - The Changebringer (CG)|Avandra]], embodying the powers of change and adaptability, countered [[Asmodeus, God of Tyranny - The Lord of the Nine Hells (LE)|Asmodeus]]'s relentless advances with cunning and resilience. The battle raged for ages, each deity unleashing their might in a relentless dance of creation and destruction.

In a decisive moment, [[Avandra, Goddess of Change, Autumn and Luck - The Changebringer (CG)|Avandra]]'s unwavering resolve and the unpredictable currents of luck turned the tide. [[Asmodeus, God of Tyranny - The Lord of the Nine Hells (LE)|Asmodeus]], blinded by his own arrogance, underestimated the forces of change arrayed against him. [[Avandra, Goddess of Change, Autumn and Luck - The Changebringer (CG)|Avandra]]'s final stroke struck true, casting [[Asmodeus, God of Tyranny - The Lord of the Nine Hells (LE)|Asmodeus]] down into the abyssal depths of [[the Nine Hells]], where he would languish for eternity, a prisoner of his own ambitions.


## The Creation of Divine Armaments

In the crucible of The Great War, as the [[True Gods]] clashed in celestial combat, they forged weapons of unparalleled power to tip the scales in their favor. These divine armaments became legendary relics, each imbued with the essence of their divine creators.

### [[Harmonious Vestiges]]

In their pursuit of balance and preservation, the [[Harmonious Gods]] crafted the **[[Harmonious Vestiges]]**. These artifacts held the essence of harmonious energies, intended to bring stability to the tumultuous world. Those deemed worthy could wield these vestiges to channel the benevolent forces that sought equilibrium.

### [[Defiant Vestiges]]

Conversely, the [[Defiant Gods]], driven by rebellion and the desire for change, forged the **[[Defiant Vestiges]]**. These weapons resonated with chaotic energies, embodying the defiance that fueled their cause. Those daring enough to wield these vestiges gained access to formidable powers capable of challenging the established order.

## Divine Wrath Unleashed

As the [[True Gods]] waged their celestial conflict during The Great War, the very fabric of [[Aeloria]] bore witness to unparalleled devastation. Cities crumbled, civilizations fell, and the once-thriving landscapes were transformed into desolate wastelands.


## [[Asmodeus, God of Tyranny - The Lord of the Nine Hells (LE)|Asmodeus]]'s Betrayal

In the midst of this cosmic upheaval, a pivotal betrayal unfolded. [[Asmodeus, God of Tyranny - The Lord of the Nine Hells (LE)|Asmodeus]], a servant of a god only known as [[He Who Was]]—his true name lost to the ravages of time—seized a moment of chaos to betray and slay his divine master. In a macabre twist of fate, [[Asmodeus, God of Tyranny - The Lord of the Nine Hells (LE)|Asmodeus]] absorbed the [[divine spark]], ascending to godhood. To cloak his nefarious act, he reached back in time, erasing any memories and records pertaining to the fallen god's name, leaving only the enigmatic title of [[He Who Was]].

The entity known as [[Asmodeus, God of Tyranny - The Lord of the Nine Hells (LE)|Asmodeus]] went to great lengths to obliterate any trace of his former identity, shrouding his past in mystery. As to the extent of his power before ascending to godhood, it remains speculative, with only whispers and fragmented tales hinting at the possibility that [[Asmodeus, God of Tyranny - The Lord of the Nine Hells (LE)|Asmodeus]] might have been exceedingly powerful, perhaps even a [[Semi-Deities|semi-deity]]. However, all concrete information about his origins and prowess was systematically erased as part of his transformation into a god.

## [[Corellon, God of Magic, Spring, Creativity and the Arts - The Spellfather (CG)|Corellon]]'s retribution against [[Lolth, Goddess of Spiders and Lies - The Spider Queen (LE)|Lolth]]

During the Great War, the elven god [[Corellon, God of Magic, Spring, Creativity and the Arts - The Spellfather (CG)|Corellon, the Spellfather]] faced the treacherous [[Lolth, Goddess of Spiders and Lies - The Spider Queen (LE)|Lolth]], [[Lolth, Goddess of Spiders and Lies - The Spider Queen (LE)|the Spider Queen]], in a climactic battle. The conflict between the two deities was fierce, with [[Corellon, God of Magic, Spring, Creativity and the Arts - The Spellfather (CG)|Corellon]] ultimately besting [[Lolth, Goddess of Spiders and Lies - The Spider Queen (LE)|Lolth]] in a tightly contested duel. The defeat of [[Lolth, Goddess of Spiders and Lies - The Spider Queen (LE)|Lolth]] was only possible due to [[Corellon, God of Magic, Spring, Creativity and the Arts - The Spellfather (CG)|the god of magic]] sending her to the depts of [[The Abyss]], where she would spend many years crawling her way back to the [[Material Plane]]. 

## Toxic Air and Decimated Reaches

The war's catastrophic consequences extended beyond the battlefield. The air itself became toxic, carrying the residue of divine strife that permeated the atmosphere. Vast reaches of [[Aeloria]] were laid to waste, with fields disintegrating, mountains crumbling, and once-prosperous lands reduced to barren expanses.

## Beings of Great Power

To further their cosmic ambitions, the [[True Gods]] created beings of immense power to serve as instruments of war. These entities, born from the chaotic energies unleashed, stalked the ravaged lands, enforcing the will of their divine creators with devastating force.

## Waters Turned Poison

Even the waters, once a source of life and sustenance, were tainted by the war's malevolent touch. Poison currents coursed through rivers and oceans, posing an additional threat to the surviving remnants of civilizations struggling to endure in the aftermath of the celestial conflict.


## [[Tharizdun, God of Entropy and Madness - The Chained Oblivion (CE)|Tharizdun]] fights [[Ioun, Goddess of Knowledge - The Enlightened (N)|Ioun]] and [[Melora, Goddess of the Wild and Sea - The Wildmother (N)|Melora]]

During the War of the Gods, a sect of Thariuzdun's devotees, driven by fanatic zeal, discovered a method to breach the god's mind prison while the followers of [[Ioun, Goddess of Knowledge - The Enlightened (N)|Ioun]], the Goddess of Knowledge, tried to stop them. But the worshipers of [[Tharizdun, God of Entropy and Madness - The Chained Oblivion (CE)|the Chained Oblivion]] stormed through [[Ioun, Goddess of Knowledge - The Enlightened (N)|Ioun]]'s attempts to defend the prision, their chaotic power overwhelming the guardians of knowledge who sought to prevent the unspeakable from being unleashed. Though they could not physically free Thariuzdun's mind, they devised a desperate scheme — injecting a corrupting concoction into the god's prison, granting a fleeting focus to the mad deity's mind.

In that moment, madness spilled forth like a noxious fog. Thariuzdun, seizing the opportunity, unleashed its chaotic power upon [[Ioun, Goddess of Knowledge - The Enlightened (N)|Ioun]]'s followers as they arrived in the mind prison, driving many to insanity and through these worshippers, assaulting the very essence of [[Ioun, Goddess of Knowledge - The Enlightened (N)|The Enlightened]]'s being. In the depths of their minds, amidst the tumult of shattered thoughts and stolen memories, the battle of intellect and madness erupted.

[[Ioun, Goddess of Knowledge - The Enlightened (N)|Ioun]], the embodiment of wisdom and learning, fought valiantly to protect her realm of knowledge. Yet, Thariuzdun's hunger for entropy was insatiable. It sought to consume every shard of knowledge, to unravel the intricate tapestry of understanding that [[Ioun, Goddess of Knowledge - The Enlightened (N)|Ioun]] held dear and find a way to escape its eternal prison. The Goddess of Knowledge, wounded and reeling, realized that to defeat Thariuzdun, she must resort to revealing a forbidden secret — a poisonous knowledge that could stun even the mad god itself.

With great sacrifice, [[Ioun, Goddess of Knowledge - The Enlightened (N)|Ioun]] hurled this forbidden lore into the maw of madness. Thariuzdun faltered, momentarily stunned by the venomous truths it had consumed. Sensing their sister's plight, [[Ioun, Goddess of Knowledge - The Enlightened (N)|Ioun]] turned to [[Melora, Goddess of the Wild and Sea - The Wildmother (N)|Melora]], [[Melora, Goddess of the Wild and Sea - The Wildmother (N)|the Wildmother]], goddess of the untamed wilds and the sea, for aid.

[[Melora, Goddess of the Wild and Sea - The Wildmother (N)|Melora]], who had observed the unfolding chaos from her verdant sanctuaries and azure depths, understood the dire threat Thariuzdun posed to the natural order. With resolute determination, she summoned her primal weapons from Jovaris, preparing to confront the encroaching madness.

As Thariuzdun recovered from the poison, it used the knowledge to twist the very creations of [[Melora, Goddess of the Wild and Sea - The Wildmother (N)|Melora]]'s domain into grotesque aberrations, mocking the beauty of [[Melora, Goddess of the Wild and Sea - The Wildmother (N)|the Wildmother]]'s realm. Enraged, [[Melora, Goddess of the Wild and Sea - The Wildmother (N)|Melora]] joined [[Ioun, Goddess of Knowledge - The Enlightened (N)|Ioun]] in a fierce psychic battle against the god of madness. Together, their powers intertwined, they unleashed torrents of elemental fury and esoteric knowledge, seeking to weaken Thariuzdun's control on their minds.

In a climactic struggle that spanned realms unseen by mortal eyes, [[Ioun, Goddess of Knowledge - The Enlightened (N)|Ioun]] and [[Melora, Goddess of the Wild and Sea - The Wildmother (N)|Melora]] weakened Thariuzdun's grasp on reality. The god of entropy, realizing its imminent defeat, retreated into the recesses of its mind prison, pursued by the resolute goddesses.

[[Ioun, Goddess of Knowledge - The Enlightened (N)|Ioun]] and [[Melora, Goddess of the Wild and Sea - The Wildmother (N)|Melora]] entered the mind prison, their combined efforts removing the corrupting substance that had enabled Thariuzdun's brief focus. Strengthening the chains that bound [[Tharizdun, God of Entropy and Madness - The Chained Oblivion (CE)|The Chained Oblivion]], they secured it once more in its eternal confinement. Yet, the victory came at a cost.

[[Ioun, Goddess of Knowledge - The Enlightened (N)|Ioun]] was left wounded, her vast repositories of knowledge diminished, forever scarred by the invasive touch of madness and the forbidden truths she had unleashed upon the world had turned into curses spread across the minds of mortals. [[Melora, Goddess of the Wild and Sea - The Wildmother (N)|Melora]], too, bore deep wounds — her beloved creations twisted and corrupted, some irreparably lost to the mockery of Thariuzdun's influence.

Despite the toll exacted upon them, [[Ioun, Goddess of Knowledge - The Enlightened (N)|Ioun]] and [[Melora, Goddess of the Wild and Sea - The Wildmother (N)|Melora]] knew that they had safeguarded the world from the brink of chaos. The realms of knowledge and the wild could once again find solace, albeit tempered by the scars of battle. Tales whispered of mutated remnants that escaped [[Melora, Goddess of the Wild and Sea - The Wildmother (N)|Melora]]'s wrath, hidden in forgotten corners of the world.

And so, the gods of knowledge and the wild rested, their vigil eternal, knowing that they had staved off the encroaching madness of Thariuzdun, at least for another age.

The battle between the two gods was fierce, with [[Bane, God of War and Conquest - The Strife Emperor (LE)|Bane]] sword piercing [[Kord, God of Strength and Storms - The Stormlord (CN)|The Stormlord]]'s stomach, causing him to stumble back before grabbing [[Bane, God of War and Conquest - The Strife Emperor (LE)|Bane]]'s shoulder and punching him in the face with a thunderous blow.

## The Siege of [[Aelor - The First City|Aelor]] and the Pact between [[Erathis, Goddess of Civilization and Invention - The Lawbearer (LN)|Erathis]] and [[Asmodeus, God of Tyranny - The Lord of the Nine Hells (LE)|Asmodeus]]

Driven by revenge and ambition, [[Asmodeus, God of Tyranny - The Lord of the Nine Hells (LE)|Asmodeus]] brokered a dark covenant with the ancient primordial forces of the world, forging his infamous Ruby Rod. This artifact granted him mastery over hellfire. With unrivaled might at his command, he launched a ruthless campaign to conquer [[the nine hells]], after gaining control of [[The Nine Hells]] he set his sights on the [[material plane]]. Commanding his infernal forces, [[Asmodeus, God of Tyranny - The Lord of the Nine Hells (LE)|Asmodeus]] sought to subjugate the mortal realms under his iron-fisted rule, starting with the city of [[Aelor - The First City|Aelor]] which fell under his siege.

[[Aelor - The First City|Aelor]], the very first bastion of mortal civilization, stood as a beacon of innovation and progress under [[Erathis, Goddess of Civilization and Invention - The Lawbearer (LN)|Erathis]]'s guiding influence. The goddess that helped build the settlement saw [[Asmodeus, God of Tyranny - The Lord of the Nine Hells (LE)|Asmodeus]]'s tyranny as an affront to her domain, a corruption that threatened to snuff out the flickering flames of mortal creativity.

In a clash of ideologies and power, [[Erathis, Goddess of Civilization and Invention - The Lawbearer (LN)|Erathis]] marshaled her forces against the infernal onslaught. The battlefield stretched across both the [[material plane]] and into the depths of [[the Nine Hells]] where [[Erathis, Goddess of Civilization and Invention - The Lawbearer (LN)|Erathis]] waged a relentless campaign to stem the tide of [[Asmodeus, God of Tyranny - The Lord of the Nine Hells (LE)|Asmodeus]]'s encroachment. In time the goddess reached the lair of [[Asmodeus, God of Tyranny - The Lord of the Nine Hells (LE)|Asmodeus]], in the deepest layer of the [[The Nine Hells|Nine Hells]], where she confronted the god in a battle that shook the entire plane.

For days that stretched into years, [[Erathis, Goddess of Civilization and Invention - The Lawbearer (LN)|Erathis]] and [[Asmodeus, God of Tyranny - The Lord of the Nine Hells (LE)|Asmodeus]] clashed in a cataclysmic duel of divine proportions. Their powers shook the very foundations of reality, leaving scars upon both mortal realms and infernal domains alike. As the battle reached its zenith and both combatants stood on the brink of annihilation, a weary truce was forged.

In a moment of begrudging respect for each other's tenacity, [[Erathis, Goddess of Civilization and Invention - The Lawbearer (LN)|Erathis]] and [[Asmodeus, God of Tyranny - The Lord of the Nine Hells (LE)|Asmodeus]] struck a pact that would echo through the ages. [[Asmodeus, God of Tyranny - The Lord of the Nine Hells (LE)|Asmodeus]] would retain dominion over the [[The Nine Hells|Nine Hells]] and its infernal denizens as [[Erathis, Goddess of Civilization and Invention - The Lawbearer (LN)|Erathis]] swore to not destroy the realm of the Tyrant god. In exchange his influence over the [[material plane]] would be channeled only through mortals who willingly entered into contracts with him or his agents, carved into the enduring Ruby Rod as a binding testament for eternity.

## Battle between the Dragon Gods, Tiamat and [[Bahamut, God  of Justice and Nobility - The Platinum Dragon (LG)]]

Before the Great War, the dragon gods Tiamat and [[Bahamut, God  of Justice and Nobility - The Platinum Dragon (LG)|Bahamut]] had worked together to create the dragons, Chromatic and Metalic, respectively. However, during the Great War, the two gods clashed in a battle that would forever mark their enmity. The battles between the two[[Bahamut, God  of Justice and Nobility - The Platinum Dragon (LG)| gods w]]ere fierce, with Tiamat's five heads spewing acid and fire at [[Bahamut, God  of Justice and Nobility - The Platinum Dragon (LG)|Bahamut]], who countered with his own breath of flame and frost. Following their creators, the dragons of the world also clashed in a battle against one another in a series of battles that would eternally mark both types of dragons as enemies. The two gods were evenly matched, and the battle ended in a stalemate, with both gods retreating to their respective domains while their children kept fighting on the battlefield, marking the world with dragonic wrath. 

## [[True Gods]] Bearing the Scars

As the [[True Gods]] unleashed these powerful artifacts upon the world, the Harmonious and [[Defiant Vestiges]] became symbols of the celestial struggle that defined The Great War. Even in the aftermath, these relics endured as reminders of a time when [[True Gods]] walked among mortals, shaping the destiny of the world with their cosmic battles.
