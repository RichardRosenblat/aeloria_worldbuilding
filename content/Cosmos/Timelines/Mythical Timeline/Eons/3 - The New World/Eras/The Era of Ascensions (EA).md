## Shaping Divinity Amidst Chaos

In the aftermath of the great celestial conflict and the subsequent healing of [[Aeloria]], a period emerged when the world lay broken, and magic ran wild and unchecked. It was during these tumultuous times that mortals sought to transcend their limitations and ascend to godhood, forever altering the divine landscape.

### Raven Queen's Ascension

A great mortal sorceress, driven by an insatiable thirst for power and guided by the whispers of the wild magic, conducted a profound ritual. In a daring act, she aspired to reach godhood, aiming to reshape the domain of death itself. In this ambitious endeavor, she took the life of [[Nerull, God of Death, Fate, and Winter - The winterlord (LN)|Nerull]], the existing god of death, snuffing out his [[divine spark]] to fuel her own, and assumed the divine mantle.

- **[[Raven Queen, Goddess of Death Crow - The Matron of Death (LN)]]**, the newly ascended Raven Queen took control of the realm of death, introducing a sense of order and balance to the transition between life and the afterlife.

### Vecna's Dark Ascent
Inspired by the audacious act of the Raven Queen, a great archlich sought to harness the chaotic magic that permeated the healing world. Employing a ritual reminiscent of the one performed by the Raven Queen, although more refined, this archlich aimed to ascend to godhood and embrace the mantle of secrets and deceit.

- [[Vecna, god of evil secrets - The Whispered One (NE)]], Vecna successfully completed the ritual and ascended to godhood, using small parts of the current [[True Gods]]' [[Divine Spark|divine sparks]] to create his own. With dominion over evil secrets, Vecna became a dark force that thrived on manipulation and hidden knowledge, further shaping the divine landscape of [[Aeloria]].
