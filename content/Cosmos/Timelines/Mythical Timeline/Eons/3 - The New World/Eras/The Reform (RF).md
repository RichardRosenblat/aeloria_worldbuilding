## Divine Reflection

Witnessing the celestial dance of new gods ascending and mortals claiming divine status, [[Aena, goddess of kindness, creation and order - The Architect (LG)|Aena]] and [[Kryela, goddess of malice, destruction and chaos - The Undoing (CE)|Kryela]], [[Over-Deities|the Twin Goddesses]], gazed upon the unfolding events with a profound cosmic wisdom. In the heart of [[the Eternal Workshop]], they convened the divine assembly, their eyes reflecting both admiration and concern for their divine children.

### Divine Wisdom Unveiled

In their timeless gaze, [[Over-Deities|the twin goddesses]] discerned the miracles and recklessness interwoven in the actions of their divine offspring. Recognizing the inevitability of change and the intrinsic value of growth, [[Aena, goddess of kindness, creation and order - The Architect (LG)|Aena]] and [[Kryela, goddess of malice, destruction and chaos - The Undoing (CE)|Kryela]] saw the emergence of Raven Queen and Vecna as unique threads in the grand tapestry of the divine pantheon.

### Embracing Uniqueness

Despite harboring reservations, [[Over-Deities|the twin goddesses]] understood the distinct roles Raven Queen and Vecna played. Raven Queen embodied the essence of death, bringing a necessary aspect to the cosmic order. Vecna, with his dark nature, held secrets that contributed to the intricate design of the cosmic tapestry.

## Concerns of Mortal Ascensions

While acknowledging the unique positions of Raven Queen and Vecna, [[Over-Deities|the twin goddesses]] harbored deep concerns regarding the mortal rituals that had facilitated their ascension. Fearing that unchecked mortal godhood could disrupt the delicate balance they had tirelessly maintained, [[Aena, goddess of kindness, creation and order - The Architect (LG)|Aena]] and [[Kryela, goddess of malice, destruction and chaos - The Undoing (CE)|Kryela]] decided to take decisive action.

### Guardians of Cosmic Balance

Understanding the potential consequences of unbridled mortal ascensions, [[Over-Deities|the twin goddesses]] resolved to safeguard the balance in creation. Their decision to intervene aimed to prevent further disruptions and maintain the harmony they had woven into the very fabric of [[Aeloria]]. The reform they envisioned would shape the future of divine ascensions and guide the destinies of both gods and mortals.

## Reshaping [[Corellon, God of Magic, Spring, Creativity and the Arts - The Spellfather (CG)|Corellon]]'s Essence

[[Aena, goddess of kindness, creation and order - The Architect (LG)|Aena]] and [[Kryela, goddess of malice, destruction and chaos - The Undoing (CE)|Kryela]], with a commitment to preserving the delicate balance of creation, turned their gaze towards [[Corellon, God of Magic, Spring, Creativity and the Arts - The Spellfather (CG)|Corellon]], the God of Magic. Recognizing the potent influence of magic in the ascension of mortals, [[Over-Deities|the twin goddesses]], in their boundless creativity, decided to redefine the very essence of [[Corellon, God of Magic, Spring, Creativity and the Arts - The Spellfather (CG)|Corellon]].

### Radiant Transformation

In a luminous instant within [[the Eternal Workshop]], [[Over-Deities|the twin goddesses]] worked their cosmic artistry on [[Corellon, God of Magic, Spring, Creativity and the Arts - The Spellfather (CG)|Corellon]]. They interwove a new aspect into his divine existence, imbuing him with the eternal responsibility of safeguarding the magic of the world. [[Corellon, God of Magic, Spring, Creativity and the Arts - The Spellfather (CG)|Corellon]]'s essence now bore the concepts of limitation and balance.

### Guardian of the Weave

Once a deity of free and unbridled magic, [[Corellon, God of Magic, Spring, Creativity and the Arts - The Spellfather (CG)|Corellon]] underwent a transformative shift. Embracing his new role, he became the Guardian of the Weave, tasked with protecting the delicate threads that wove the fabric of reality together. The unrestrained forces of magic were now tethered by his divine mandate.

## Limiting Mortal Ascensions

This alteration in [[Corellon, God of Magic, Spring, Creativity and the Arts - The Spellfather (CG)|Corellon]]'s essence served a vital purpose—to curtail the mortal path to godhood. The cosmic forces of creation and magic, now regulated and bound by [[Corellon, God of Magic, Spring, Creativity and the Arts - The Spellfather (CG)|Corellon]]'s influence, imposed a restraint that would prevent mortals from ascending through the same means.

### Erasing the Traces

As the final stroke in their cosmic canvas, [[Aena, goddess of kindness, creation and order - The Architect (LG)|Aena]] and [[Kryela, goddess of malice, destruction and chaos - The Undoing (CE)|Kryela]], wielding their omnipotent abilities, embarked on a profound act. They cleansed the world of every remnant of past magic—every thread of arcane energy, hidden rune, and ancient artifact imbued with mystical power. With cosmic gestures, they erased all traces of magic from the world.

### Godly Sacrifice

This act, while preserving the balance, came at a cost. The gods themselves used the magical the magical essence of the world to connect with their worshippers, and with magic erased, they experienced temporary weakness. The connection between the divine and mortal realms grew thin, marking a momentary sacrifice that [[Over-Deities|the twin goddesses]] deemed necessary for the greater good.

### A Second Chance

[[Aena, goddess of kindness, creation and order - The Architect (LG)|Aena]] and [[Kryela, goddess of malice, destruction and chaos - The Undoing (CE)|Kryela]] believed in the necessity of this sacrifice to provide the mortal realm a second chance to grow without damaging the harmony of balance. Liberated from the temptations and dangers of unchecked magic, they envisioned a new form of magic that mortals would gradually master. This magic would be shaped by the experiences and wisdom of mortals, ensuring a harmonious and balanced existence in the reborn world.

## The Reform: Cosmic Unraveling

### The Three Days of Cosmic Unrest

As [[Aena, goddess of kindness, creation and order - The Architect (LG)|Aena]] and [[Kryela, goddess of malice, destruction and chaos - The Undoing (CE)|Kryela]] initiated their cosmic reform, three tumultuous days unfolded, marking a transformative epoch for both gods and mortals alike. The mortal realm experienced chaos as the divine powers granted by the gods abruptly ceased to function, and the repercussions of the reform took hold.

### First Day: For the Bright Sky

- **Celestial Chaos:**
  - At midnight, the skies erupted with an intense luminosity, stars forming a symphony of radiant brilliance. Night turned to day and back again, shifting dozens of times within mere hours, leaving mortals bewildered.
  - Sacred sites and magical locations resonated with newfound energy, their auras pulsating with the cosmic changes. Divine representations glowed, casting beams into the sky like beacons of the divine.

- **Divine Disconnection:**
  - Divine spells abruptly ceased to function, leaving clerics and paladins without their granted powers.
  - Ethereal whispers permeated the air, conveying cryptic messages to those attuned to the divine. Among them, a mysterious enigma echoed: "The world slows down and the sunbeams fade. The pendulum slows down, once for the bright sky, twice for the pig sty, and thrice for another day."

### Second Day: For the Pig Sty

- **Arcane Upheaval:**
  - At midday, chaos gripped the natural world as all caged animals were liberated when their enclosures shattered.
  - Magical runes and arcane symbols intensified, resonating like bells and tuning forks. Surfaces adorned with these symbols fractured as the symbols vanished.
  - Magical items crumbled, their arcane essences dissolving into nothingness.
  - Arcane spells weakened, losing their usual potency.

- **Celestial Spectacle:**
  - Nightfall brought a mesmerizing display as [[Astronomical objects]] streaked across the sky at incredible speeds. Stars left trails of brilliance, turning the heavens into a breathtaking canvas of motion.
  - Time itself became fluid, distorting instants and providing mortals with glimpses of alternate realities, where past and future danced before their eyes.

### **Third Day: For Another Day*

- **Gravity-Defying Rain:**
  - During the daytime, rain defied gravity, falling upwards—an awe-inspiring anomaly defying the laws of nature.
    
- **Memory Crystallization:**
  - At midday, gemstones orbited the heads of mortals, crystallizing memories of the past, present, and future. These stones then fell to the ground, shattering as they released the memories they held.
  - Eleven at night marked the rupture of temples dedicated to [[Corellon, God of Magic, Spring, Creativity and the Arts - The Spellfather (CG)|Corellon]], with fractures appearing at every representation of the deity.

- **Divine Manifestations:**
  - Transient temples of divine energy manifested across [[Aeloria]], showcasing overwhelming power. These ethereal structures vanished as quickly as they appeared, leaving a lasting impact on those fortunate enough to witness their fleeting presence.

- **Magic's Final Breath:**
  - All remaining magical symbols underwent rapid changes before evaporating completely.
  - Arcane spells ceased to function entirely, leaving wizards powerless.

The three days of cosmic unrest forever altered the landscape of [[Aeloria]], marking the culmination of [[Over-Deities|the twin goddesses]]' reform and setting the stage for a new era.
