In the Eon known as "The New World," spanning a vast 20 thousand years from ancient times to the current era, [[Aeloria]] experienced profound transformations that shaped the very fabric of existence. The [[The Era of Ascensions (EA)|Era of Ascensions]] witnessed mortals ascending to godhood, with the Raven Queen and Vecna taking prominent roles, reshaping the divine landscape. The subsequent Reform, occurring 11 thousand years ago, initiated by [[Over-Deities|the Twin Goddesses]] [[Aena, goddess of kindness, creation and order - The Architect (LG)|Aena]] and [[Kryela, goddess of malice, destruction and chaos - The Undoing (LE)|Kryela]], aimed to safeguard cosmic balance, limiting mortal ascensions and redefining [[Corellon, God of Magic and the Arts - The Spellfather (CG)|Corellon]]'s essence. This divine intervention led to three tumultuous days of cosmic unrest, erasing traces of past magic. The following era, The [[The New Arcane (NA)|New Arcane]], unfolded over 11 thousand years, marked by the absence and gradual return of magic, guided by [[Corellon, God of Magic and the Arts - The Spellfather (CG)|Corellon]]'s responsibility. Mortals, now cautious and responsible wielders of magic, upheld the delicate balance of [[Aeloria]], becoming guardians of the mystical arts. The Eon encapsulates a dynamic interplay of divine ascensions, cosmic reforms, and the resurgence of magic, shaping the destiny of [[Aeloria]] across millennia.
