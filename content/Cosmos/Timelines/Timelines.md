## Perspectives and Perceptions

In [[Aeloria]], the concept of a singular, objective history is a fleeting illusion. Ask different inhabitants about the past, and you'll unravel a kaleidoscope of narratives. Culture, beliefs, discoveries, and biases collectively paint a vivid and ever-changing tableau of historical events.

Across the Veiled Lands, a consensus has formed regarding the events of the past thousand years.

The gods themselves might reveal one version of the past, scholars another, while ancient ruins whisper secrets of an entirely different era.

## A Note from the Writer
Greetings, intrepid seekers of [[Aeloria]]'s history! 

As the one creating these notes to you, I must share a bittersweet revelation. 
Within the pages of the timelines of [[Aeloria]], you may encounter code blocks, I use them to generate captivating timeline images in Obsidian. 
Unfortunately, Quartz, the software weaving my notes into this website, do not support such visualizations. 

While Quartz may not capture the visual aspect of these timelines, I encourage you to immerse yourself in the tapestry of words and let your imagination paint the pictures that transcend the limitations of digital realms. I promise to keep them as organized as possible so that you may understand it better. 

May your journey through [[Aeloria]]'s history be as boundless as the realms of your own imagination.
